## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CHANGES

### SLIDE 1: COVER
**Original:**
- Title: "The Rumi App"
- Subtitle: "A Spiritual Wisdom Companion for the Modern World"
- Tagline: "~ Rumi as a living teacher — daily authentic, and deeply human"
- Authors listed: "John Wyrick and Todd Bowen Phd"

**New:**
- Title: "The Rumi App"
- Subtitle: "A Spiritual Wisdom Companion for the Modern World"
- **REMOVED:** Tagline and author names
- **ADDED:** Design guidance for cleaner, more professional look

**Why:** Cover should be visual impact only. Names go on team slide. Cleaner = more professional for investors.

---

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (formerly slides 2-4)

**Original Slides 2-4 Combined:**
- **Slide 2:** "The Human Need" - Listed societal issues (anxiety, disconnection, fragmentation)
- **Slide 3:** "Why Rumi?" - Listed Rumi's popularity and credentials
- **Slide 4:** "The Problem" - Fragmentation of Rumi content today

**New Slide 2:**
- **Combined all three** into single "Problem" slide
- **Focus:** "Rumi is Everywhere — But Nowhere Fully Embodied"
- **Structure:** Problem → Insight
- **Key addition:** "People don't want more content. They want a teacher."

**Why:** Original was too scattered. Investors need problem stated clearly in ONE slide. The insight is the key investment thesis.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** Generic anxiety stats (every pitch says this)
- **REMOVED:** "Social media creates toxic environment" (too preachy)
- **REMOVED:** "Our hypothesis: People don't want more content. They want guidance." (turned into declarative insight)
- **KEPT:** Core fragmentation points
- **ADDED:** "The Fragmentation Crisis" framing
- **ADDED:** Specific reference to 25,000 verses (shows scale)

---

### SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY (NEW)

**Original:** No equivalent slide. Market context buried in slide 12.

**New:**
- **Title:** "The Most-Read Poet Meets the Most Underserved Market"
- **Structure:** Rumi's Reach → Market Size → Whitespace
- **Key stat callouts:** Market size in billions, daily users, growth rate
- **Conclusion:** "No app has created a daily relationship with the depth and authenticity of classical mystical poetry."

**Why:** Investors need to see TAM (Total Addressable Market) early. This proves there's a business, not just a beautiful idea.

**What Was Added:**
- Specific market size data (bracketed for Yalor to fill)
- Mindfulness app market context
- Competitive landscape numbers
- "The Whitespace" positioning statement
- Design note for visual data presentation

---

### SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION

**Original (Slide 5):**
- Title: "The Solution"
- Subtitle: "The Rumi App we've built restores Rumi as a living spiritual teacher."
- Bullet list of features
- No visuals specified

**New:**
- **Title:** "Rumi as a Living Teacher — Daily, Authentic, Deeply Human"
- **Tagline:** "A sanctuary, not a feed."
- **Same features** but reorganized
- **CRITICAL ADDITION:** "SHOW THE APP" - multiple iPhone mockups

**Why:** This is the most important slide. Investors must SEE the product, not just read about it.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **CHANGED:** "Daily wisdom delivered gently" → "One verse per day, delivered gently" (more specific)
- **CHANGED:** "Full depth available when mystic's heart is ready" → "Full Masnavi access — all 25,000 verses, structured and searchable" (less poetic, more concrete)
- **ADDED:** "Shams of Tabriz corpus prepared for future release" (shows pipeline)
- **ADDED:** Bottom line: "Depth without overwhelm. Wisdom without dogma. Beauty without distraction."

---

### SLIDE 5: PRODUCT FEATURES (formerly slides 6 & 8)

**Original Slides 6 & 8:**
- **Slide 6:** Daily Rumi Wisdom (feature details)
- **Slide 8:** Guided Journeys (separate slide)

**New Slide 5:**
- **Combined both** into single "How It Works" slide
- **Four features** in quadrant layout:
  1. Daily Wisdom
  2. Contemplation Mode
  3. Guided Journeys
  4. The Complete Masnavi
- **Added icons** (📿 🌙 🧭 📖)

**Why:** Consolidation reduces slide count. Icons make it scannable. Four-quadrant layout is standard in app pitches.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** "* One verse per day. * Quiet notification" (asterisk format)
- **CHANGED to:** Emoji + headline + italic subtitle format
- **ADDED:** "The Complete Masnavi" as standalone feature (was buried before)
- **ADDED:** "No other app offers this depth" (competitive differentiation)
- **KEPT:** Guided journey details but made more concise

---

### SLIDE 6: WHAT WE'VE ALREADY BUILT

**Original (Slide 7):**
- Title: "SLIDE 7— What We Have Already Built"
- Subtitle: "This is not a concept — it already exists!"
- Checklist with purple checkmarks
- "Years of work already embodied!"

**New:**
- **Title:** "This Is Not a Concept — It Already Exists"
- **Structure:** Content Complete → Product Ready → What This Means
- Same checklist items but reorganized

**Why:** Original was good but too exclamatory. New version is confident without being defensive.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** "SLIDE 7" label (not needed)
- **REMOVED:** Exclamation points ("it already exists!" → "It Already Exists")
- **REMOVED:** "Years of work already embodied!" (implied, not stated)
- **ADDED:** "Content Complete" vs "Product Ready" section headers
- **ADDED:** Bracketed placeholders for specific numbers
- **ADDED:** Closing statement: "We've de-risked the hardest part: creating world-class spiritual content with integrity."

---

### SLIDE 7: TRACTION (NEW)

**Original:** No traction slide. No metrics anywhere.

**New:**
- **Title:** "Early Validation"
- **Sections:** Beta Program → User Feedback → Press & Recognition
- **Note:** "Only include this slide if you have data. If not, skip..."

**Why:** Every investor pitch needs proof of demand. If no data exists, slide gets removed, but the placeholder is there.

**What Was Added:**
- Beta user metrics (bracketed)
- Engagement stats (weekly active, session time)
- Pull quote format for testimonials
- Press/award section
- Design note about removing if no data

---

### SLIDE 8: BUSINESS MODEL (NEW)

**Original:** No business model slide. Pricing not mentioned.

**New:**
- **Title:** "How We Make Money"
- **Structure:** Revenue Model → Unit Economics → Revenue Projections
- **Includes:** Free vs Premium comparison, pricing, CAC/LTV, 3-year revenue table

**Why:** This is the #1 missing element from the original deck. Investors will not fund an app without seeing the business model.

**What Was Added:**
- Freemium tier breakdown
- Specific pricing (bracketed)
- CAC, LTV, conversion rate
- Revenue projections table (Year 1-3)
- Design note for visual table/chart

---

### SLIDE 9: GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY (NEW)

**Original:** No GTM slide.

**New:**
- **Title:** "How We Reach Seekers"
- **Structure:** Target Audience → Acquisition Channels → Why This Works
- **Channels:** Organic, Paid, Partnerships

**Why:** Investors need to know you can acquire users profitably. Original deck assumed demand would just appear.

**What Was Added:**
- Primary/secondary audience definitions
- Organic channels (ASO, content, community)
- Paid channels (social, search ads, podcasts)
- Partnership strategy (meditation centers, influencers)
- Closing line: "Rumi already has 800 years of brand equity. We're not building awareness — we're channeling existing demand."

---

### SLIDE 10: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (NEW)

**Original (Slide 12 - "Market Context"):**
- Title: "Market Context (High Level)"
- Very generic: "multi-billion dollar market"
- Listed intersection points (Culture, Spirituality, Literature, Technology)
- No specific competitors mentioned

**New:**
- **Title:** "The Market Gap We Fill"
- **Structure:** Competitive table → Our Differentiation
- **Specific competitors:** Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer, Quote apps
- **Strengths/Weaknesses** for each

**Why:** Original was too vague. Investors want to see you understand the competition specifically.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** "Global mindfulness & spiritual apps: multi-billion dollar market" (moved to Opportunity slide)
- **REMOVED:** "This sits at the intersection of Culture/Spirituality/Literature/Technology" (too abstract)
- **ADDED:** Specific competitor analysis with honest assessment
- **ADDED:** Clear differentiation points
- **ADDED:** "We are the only app that treats Rumi as a teacher, not a quote database."

---

### SLIDE 11: THE PLATFORM VISION

**Original (Slide 10 - "The Bigger Vision"):**
- Title: "The Bigger Vision (The Platform)"
- "Rumi is the gateway — not the end."
- List of future poets

**New:**
- **Title:** "Rumi Is the Gateway — Not the End"
- **Structure:** Mission → Future Expansion → Why This Matters to Investors
- Same poet list but better organized

**Why:** Original was good but didn't connect vision to investor value.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **KEPT:** Core vision statement (was already strong)
- **REORGANIZED:** "In Development" vs "Roadmap" poets
- **ADDED:** "Why This Matters to Investors" section
- **ADDED:** "Platform optionality. Repeatable model. Expanding TAM with each tradition we honor."
- **REMOVED:** Green text emphasis (will be handled in design)

---

### SLIDE 12: TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP (formerly Slide 11)

**Original (Slide 11 - "The AI Dimension"):**
- Title: "The AI Dimension (Future, Grounded)"
- Later phase AI-assisted guidance
- "We are approaching this ethically, and carefully as a sacred Mission."

**New:**
- **Title:** "Ethical AI, Grounded in Tradition"
- **Structure:** Phase 1 (Current) → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (AI)
- **Added:** Product roadmap context before AI

**Why:** Original jumped straight to AI without showing current product roadmap. Investors need to see near-term execution first.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **ADDED:** Phase 1 (Launch) - current features
- **ADDED:** Phase 2 (Personalization) - learning paths, custom journeys
- **KEPT:** Phase 3 (AI) but made it clearly future
- **CHANGED:** "We are approaching this ethically, and carefully as a sacred Mission." → "We will never compromise the integrity of these teachings for engagement metrics."
- **REMOVED:** Red/orange color emphasis
- **ADDED:** "Rumi as guide — not chatbot" tagline

---

### SLIDE 13: ROADMAP & MILESTONES (NEW)

**Original:** No timeline/milestone slide.

**New:**
- **Title:** "The Path Forward"
- **Structure:** Quarterly milestones from Pre-Launch → Scale
- **Includes:** User targets, revenue targets, break-even timing

**Why:** Investors need to see concrete execution plan with measurable milestones.

**What Was Added:**
- Q-by-Q roadmap (bracketed for Yalor to fill dates)
- Specific targets: downloads, users, ARR
- Break-even milestone
- Series A timing
- Design note for visual timeline

---

### SLIDE 14: THE TEAM

**Original (Slide 13):**
- Title: "SLIDE 13 — The Team"
- Text-only descriptions
- No photos
- Two people: John Wyrick, Todd Bowden

**New:**
- **Title:** "Builders of Sacred Technology"
- **Structure:** Core Team (2) → Advisors (3+)
- **Added:** Photo placeholders for everyone
- **Added:** Advisor section

**Why:** Investors invest in people. Text-only team slides look amateur. Photos + advisors = credibility.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **KEPT:** John Wyrick credentials (already strong)
- **KEPT:** Todd Bowden credentials
- **FIXED:** "Todd Bowen" → "Todd Bowden" (original had typo)
- **ADDED:** Bracketed placeholders for additional credentials
- **ADDED:** Advisor section with photo placeholders
- **ADDED:** Design note for layout (2 core team large, 3-4 advisors smaller)
- **REMOVED:** Purple text formatting

---

### SLIDE 15: THE ASK (formerly Slides 14-15)

**Original Slides 14-15:**
- **Slide 14:** "How We're Thinking About Funding (Soft)"
  - "We are exploring a small, aligned funding round"
  - "More important than capital is alignment and counsel."
- **Slide 15:** "Why we are Sharing This With You"
  - "We are not bringing this as a pitch."
  - "If this resonates: I'd value your guidance..."

**New Slide 15:**
- **Title:** "Join Us in Bringing Rumi to the World"
- **Structure:** Raise Amount → Use of Funds → Investment Gets Us To → Investor Benefits
- **Specific ask:** Dollar amount, equity, milestones

**Why:** Original was weak and apologetic. New version is clear, confident, professional.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **REMOVED ENTIRELY:** "We are not bringing this as a pitch" (terrible for fundraising)
- **REMOVED:** "More important than capital is alignment and counsel" (sounds like you don't need money)
- **REMOVED:** "Why we are Sharing This With You" (unnecessary justification)
- **ADDED:** Specific dollar amount (bracketed)
- **ADDED:** Use of funds breakdown (% and $ for Product, Marketing, Team, Ops)
- **ADDED:** "This Investment Gets Us To:" with specific milestones
- **ADDED:** Investor benefits section
- **CHANGED:** From soft/apologetic → direct/confident

---

### SLIDE 16: CLOSING

**Original:**
- Title: "SLIDE 16 — Closing"
- Rumi quote: "Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames."

**New:**
- **Title:** "The Invitation"
- **Opening:** "There is a voice that doesn't use words. Listen."
- **Body:** "For centuries, Rumi has been a companion to seekers..."
- **Closing:** "Not as content. As guidance. Not as a feed. As a sanctuary."
- **CTA:** "We invite you to help us build it."
- **Contact info** included

**Why:** Original quote was nice but didn't close the ask. New version is poetic but includes call to action and contact info.

**Major Copy Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** "Set your life on fire" quote (too aggressive for closing)
- **ADDED:** Softer Rumi-style opening
- **ADDED:** Vision statement with parallelism ("Not as content. As guidance.")
- **ADDED:** Clear invitation
- **ADDED:** Contact information (bracketed)
- **ADDED:** Design note for visual/emotional layout

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Original Deck:** A beautiful vision document that reads like an artist's statement or a manifesto. Passionate but not investable.

**New Deck:** A complete investor pitch that proves there's a real business built on authentic spiritual content. Shows both heart and rigor.

**The transformation:** From "please resonate with our vision" to "here's why this is a multi-million dollar opportunity and how we'll execute."

**Rumi's voice preserved in:** the poetry of the mission, but wrapped in the discipline of business fundamentals.
