# INTRODUCTION TO CONSTRUCTING THE CONSCIOUS BUSINESS
## OR HOW TO MAKE A REAL BOY

Let us not kid ourselves. We want to be like Geppetto who wanted to make a real boy. We want to give life to our creations. We want to make our businesses alive with all the wonder and capacity of something that is alive. But what does it mean to be alive and what is meant in the context of awakening a conscious business?

Just to investigate let's start by looking the at ideas of Fritjof Capra, the famous physicist who espoused chaos theory and systems theory. We will discuss this briefly just to inspire thought and creativity.

## The Five Principles of Living Systems

The first idea was that life has self-organization.

### Self-Organization

This principle is drawn from the field of complex systems and chaos theory. It refers to the process by which order, and structure spontaneously arise in a system from interactions among its parts, without need for central control. Examples of self-organizing systems include ecosystems, economies, and human brains. In a corporate sense this means that the team that is establishing the business is working for towards

### Self-Healing

This is a principle often associated with biology and psychology, referring to the capacity of a living organism to restore its own health and equilibrium in the face of disease or injury. This principle is visible in phenomena such as wound healing in the body or psychological resilience in the face of trauma. As applied to a corporate entity it is about the ability of management to respond to the challenges of a company and that the business has the motivation to heal its dysfunctional parts.

### Self-Transcendence

This is a more psychological and spiritual concept, referring to the ability of a person (or, by metaphorical extension, a system) to grow, evolve, and transcend its current limits or boundaries. This can involve personal development, spiritual growth, or the evolution of new capacities or levels of awareness. This is often communicated in the business world as "Innovate or die". It is the ability to read into the future enough to be flexible in the face of current and future conditions and circumstances and to make the changes that are needed, not only in the sense of survival but also to thrive.

### Self-Replication

This is the observation that living entities are Self-Replicating referring to a biological entity to replace itself and thus a whole species can survive. It is not necessarily from a business perspective about being able to reproduce to make a new company or business but more about the knowledge, production and product of a company to scale of "replicate" itself in such a manner that the power of the corporate entity can become a change maker.

### Self-Renewal

This is the quality of a company to renew itself repeatedly. This can be done though reorganization, changing and renewing the corporate culture, relocation, catapulting the move from brick and mortar to full digitization, connecting or merging with other corporations to enhance, develop and recreate the entity.

# Installing the Spiral Dynamics vMemes into the Corporate Conscious Self (CCS)

Let's explore how the progression of evolution through the various vMemes of Spiral Dynamics can be incorporated into the development and growth of a corporate entity, bringing it to life with the power of each meme:

## 1. Beige Meme: Survival Instincts

At the Beige Meme level, the focus is on basic survival instincts. This is stage 1 in the establishment of CCS. In the context of a corporate entity, this represents the initial formation of the company, where the primary concern is survival. This usually involves securing or foraging for funding, establishing a physical or virtual presence, and ensuring basic operational functions.

## 2. Purple Meme: Building the Tribe

As the corporate entity evolves, it begins to adopt the characteristics of the Purple Meme, emphasizing tribe building by acquiring like hearted individuals who are inspired and capable to help build the CCS. This stage involves the formation of a cohesive company culture based on shared values, traditions, and rituals. More than just hired employees are brought into the tribe to foster belongingness and thus can feel and take possession of their new position. This develops the sense of co-ownership and buy in that establishes loyalty to the organization thus creating a supportive and unified workforce and a general feeling of being part of something bigger and more important than just "getting a job". The stories of individual employees and the origin story of the company and the visions of the company founders are all part of establishing corporate purpose and hint and aim towards a shared destiny. The Corporate Tribe both enfolds the new employee by holding them through the integration process and passing to them the skills they need to fulfill their position and responsibilities and helps to unfold their power within their new position mentoring them into skillful means.

## 3. Red Meme: Power Gods or the Development of Personal Agency

With growth and success, the corporate entity transitions to the Red Meme stage, characterized by assertiveness and individualism. Here, the company asserts its presence in the market with confidence and ambition. Leadership demonstrates strong vision and decisiveness, driving the company forward with bold initiatives and entrepreneurial spirit.

At the individual employee level, the various employees are inspired to take possession of their position and use their agency and assertiveness to function in their most capable manner using their skill and resilience to fulfill their position and to fulfill their desired individual work goals for their self and their own posterity.

## 4. Blue Meme: Mythic Order

As the corporate entity continues to evolve, it adopts the principles of the Blue Meme, emphasizing structure, rules, and order. This stage involves the establishment of standardized processes, policies, and governance structures to ensure stability and consistency. This stage also manages the overzealous aspects of the agency released by the Red Meme. The company adheres to ethical principles and values, prioritizing accountability, and responsibility. Metrics for understanding progress and setbacks are established. Complex infrastructure is setup to support the upcoming complex achievements that come on with the arising of the orange meme. Behavior rules are written up to support corporate and individual moral values and systems of protecting the employees and the greater tribe as well as protecting the many missions of the corporation. Honor, duty and integrity are promoted, recognized celebrated as an integral part of the corporate culture.

## 5. Orange Meme: Going for Achievement

Since the infrastructure and merit evaluation processes were established by the Blue Meme it is now possible to Go for Achievement.

At the Orange Meme level, the corporate entity embraces innovation, achievement, and success. This stage involves a focus on strategic planning, goal setting, and results-oriented performance. The company pursues growth opportunities, implements cutting-edge technologies, and drives efficiency and profitability. Building a following and developing email lists and communicating the desirability of the company's service or products and supporting the sales team are a big part of all of this stage including developing the corporate intellectual property. Branding or communicating how to connect to the services or how to acquire the corporate products come at this stage.

It is a time for the company to communicate its substance through optics and theatrics (advertising) and social media presence.

## 6. Green Meme: Communitarian Societal

Here, the company prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as environmental sustainability practices. It engages with stakeholders and adopts socially conscious business practices that present the heart essence of the Conscious Corporate Self. The company is seen at compassionate and generous and takes control of the needs of the greater world through setting examples of social responsibility and genuine kindness to all.

As the corporate entity reaches the Yellow Meme stage, it embraces systems thinking and holistic perspectives.
