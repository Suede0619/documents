# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## The Rumi App: A Spiritual Wisdom Companion

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 29, 2024
**Stakeholders:** John Wyrick (Founder/Spiritual Director), Todd Bowden PhD (Co-Founder/Tech Lead), Yalor (BD/PM), Suede (Design/Production)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Overview
The Rumi App transforms the world's most-read poet into a living spiritual teacher through a mobile application that delivers daily wisdom, guided contemplative journeys, and complete access to the Masnavi's 25,000 verses. Unlike existing quote apps or meditation platforms, this product creates a structured spiritual path grounded in authentic source texts.

### Vision
A sanctuary, not a feed. A digital platform where ancient mystical poetry becomes accessible daily practice without dilution or commercialization.

**Beyond Product:** The Rumi App is being built as a Corporate Conscious Self (CCS)—a living organizational entity guided by integral principles of self-organization, self-healing, self-transcendence, and self-renewal. This is conscious capitalism in action: a business designed not only for financial success but as a vehicle for addressing humanity's meaning crisis.

### Success Criteria
1. **Fundraising Deck Completion** - Professional investor-ready pitch deck (current phase)
2. **App Design** - Full UI/UX design system for iOS and Android (next phase)
3. **Product Launch** - Public release with [target] users in first 12 months
4. **Platform Expansion** - Proven model repeatable for Hafez, Shams of Tabriz, and other mystical poets
5. **Organizational Evolution** - Demonstrate corporate consciousness through ethical decision-making, stakeholder well-being, and social impact

## CONSCIOUS BUSINESS FRAMEWORK

### Building a Corporate Conscious Self (CCS)

The Rumi App is designed from inception as a living organizational entity, embodying principles from Spiral Dynamics, systems theory, and conscious capitalism. This framework informs all aspects of the business—from employee culture to investor relationships to product design.

### Core Principles (Fritjof Capra's Living Systems)

**1. Self-Organization**
- Team functions with distributed authority, not top-down control
- Organic collaboration between spiritual vision (John), technical execution (Todd), business strategy (Yalor), and design (Suede)
- Decisions emerge from dialogue and shared purpose

**2. Self-Healing**
- Company identifies and addresses dysfunction through transparent communication
- Commitment to learn from failures and adapt
- Stakeholder feedback loops inform continuous improvement

**3. Self-Transcendence**
- "Innovate or die" applied with spiritual integrity
- Platform vision (multiple poets) shows capacity to evolve beyond initial product
- Willingness to adapt business model, features, and strategy based on user needs and market conditions

**4. Self-Replication**
- Repeatable model: Each mystical poet becomes a standalone app
- Knowledge transfer: Learnings from Rumi App inform Hafez, Shams, and future expansions
- Scaling through replication of proven template, not dilution of quality

**5. Self-Renewal**
- Continuous content creation (new guided journeys, translations, retellings)
- Product iteration based on user feedback
- Cultural renewal through employee well-being and growth opportunities

### Spiral Dynamics Integration

The company aspires to operate at **second-tier consciousness (Yellow/Turquoise)** while honoring all developmental stages:

**Current Stage Evolution:**
- **Beige (Survival):** Securing seed funding, establishing operational basics
- **Purple (Tribe):** Building cohesive team culture with shared spiritual/business values
- **Red (Agency):** Empowering team members to take ownership of their domains
- **Blue (Order):** Establishing processes, metrics, ethical guidelines
- **Orange (Achievement):** Building product, acquiring users, generating revenue
- **Green (Community):** DEI commitment, stakeholder well-being, social responsibility
- **Yellow (Integral):** Systems thinking, holistic approach to business + spirituality
- **Turquoise (Global Holistic):** Addressing humanity's meaning crisis through scaled wisdom delivery

### Why This Matters for Design

**Investor Deck:**
- Communicates depth of mission without sacrificing business clarity
- Positions company as both financially viable AND socially impactful
- Appeals to conscious investors seeking purpose-driven opportunities

**App Design:**
- No dark patterns or manipulation (honors user agency)
- Prioritizes well-being over engagement metrics
- Designed for transformation, not addiction

**Team Culture:**
- Design work treated as sacred contribution, not just deliverables
- Feedback loops that honor designer autonomy and expertise
- Space for creative exploration within business constraints

### Stakeholder Alignment

**Users:** Receive authentic spiritual guidance, not commodified content
**Employees:** Work with purpose, dignity, and fair compensation
**Investors:** Returns generated through genuine value creation, not exploitation
**Tradition:** Rumi's teachings honored with scholarly rigor and cultural respect
**Society:** Meaningful contribution to addressing isolation, fragmentation, meaning crisis

All copy has been written and documented in `rumi-deck-copy.md`. Designer responsibilities:
1. **Layout copy** according to design notes in the doc
2. **Request clarification** from Yalor on all bracketed placeholders [X]
3. **Typeset carefully** - Rumi quotes require special treatment (larger serif, breathing room)
4. **Maintain hierarchy** - H1, H2, H3 from markdown translate to visual hierarchy

### Assets Required from Client

Reference `questions-for-yalor.md` for complete list. Critical items:

**Must Have Before Design:**
1. Funding amount and terms
2. Business model and pricing
3. Financial projections (user growth, revenue)
4. Team photos (professional headshots)
5. Traction data (or confirmation to remove Slide 7)

**Nice to Have:**
1. Actual app screenshots (if available)
2. User testimonials
3. Press mentions
4. Logo/brand assets

**Workflow:**
1. Designer sends `questions-for-yalor.md` to Yalor
2. Yalor fills in bracketed items in `rumi-deck-copy.md`
3. Designer receives filled copy + assets
4. Design begins in Figma

### Success Metrics for Phase 1
- **Deck completion:** All 16 slides designed, copy integrated, data visualized
- **Client approval:** John, Todd, and Yalor sign off
- **Investor-ready:** Professional quality comparable to `metacampus.pdf` reference deck

- App facilitates, doesn't preach
- Respect user's own spiritual path

### 3. **Beauty Without Distraction**
- Design serves content, never competes

- Timeless aesthetic, not trendy
- Silence and space are design elements

### 4. **Guidance Without Gamification**

## BRAND IDENTITY (Preliminary)

### Positioning
"The Rumi App is the only spiritual companion that treats Rumi as a teacher, not a quote database."

### Brand Attributes
- **Authentic** - Scholarly source texts, not watered-down interpretations
- **Contemplative** - Designed for stillness, not scrolling
- **Deep** - 25,000 verses, not 100 quotes
- **Accessible** - Modern retellings make ancient wisdom relatable
- **Respectful** - Honors tradition without dogma

### Tone of Voice

**In the App:**
- Gentle, not pushy
- Poetic, not flowery
- Invitational, not prescriptive
- Wise, not preachy

**In Marketing:**
- Confident, not apologetic
- Clear, not vague
- Substantive, not shallow
- Inspirational, not manipulative

**Example Contrasts:**
- ❌ "Unlock your best self with Rumi!" (manipulative, New Age-y)
- ✅ "Rumi as a living teacher — daily, authentic, deeply human" (authentic, clear)

- ❌ "You've earned a 7-day streak!" (gamified, shallow)
- ✅ "A verse waits for you when you're ready." (gentle, respectful)

### Visual Identity

**Colors:**
- TBD (will develop in Phase 1 deck design)
- Likely: Deep blues, soft golds, cream/ivory backgrounds
- Avoid: Neon, primary colors, overly saturated palettes

**Typography:**
- Serif for Rumi's words (dignity, timelessness)
- Sans-serif for UI (clarity, modernity)
- Generous line height and letter spacing (readability, calm)

**Imagery:**
- Existing Rumi illustration (establish if this is "the" brand asset)
- Abstract Persian-inspired patterns (not literal arabesques)
- Minimal use of photography
- Never stock photos of "diverse people meditating"

---

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Direct Competitors

**1. Meditation Apps**
- **Calm** - Generic guided meditations, sleep stories, no textual depth
- **Headspace** - Clinical, therapeutic, Western psychology-focused
- **Insight Timer** - Huge library, overwhelming, no curation
- **Stoic** - Philosophy app, similar model but Stoic texts instead of Rumi

**2. Quote Apps**
- Various "Daily Rumi" apps - Fragmented quotes, no context
- Quote aggregators - Random inspiration, no teaching structure

**3. Religious/Spiritual Apps**
- Bible apps - Structured scripture reading, but Christian-focused
- Quran apps - Similar to our approach but for Islamic scripture
- Pray.com - Christian meditation and prayer

### Our Differentiation
✓ **Only app with complete Masnavi** (25,000 verses)
✓ **Only app with scholarly + modern retellings**
✓ **Only app treating Rumi as teacher, not quote source**
✓ **Non-denominational** yet authentically rooted in tradition
✓ **Depth + accessibility** in one experience

### Design Opportunities from Competitive Analysis

**What works in competitors:**
- Calm: Beautiful, minimal design; strong onboarding
- Headspace: Friendly, approachable illustration style
- Insight Timer: Powerful search and filter options
- Bible apps: Structured reading plans, verse-of-the-day

**What doesn't work (avoid):**
- Calm: Can feel generic, lacks depth
- Headspace: Too clinical, loses spiritual dimension
- Insight Timer: Overwhelming choice, no curation
- Quote apps: Fragmented, shallow, ad-heavy

**Our design must:**
- Match Calm's beauty while exceeding its depth
- Match Bible app's structure while remaining non-dogmatic
- Exceed Insight Timer's content while maintaining curation
- Avoid quote app's fragmentation through context and narrative

- Design trial activation and expiration UX
- Grace period after trial ends

**4. Subscription Management**
- Easy to cancel (legally required, ethically right)
- Clear communication of billing
- Renewal reminders (helpful, not dark pattern)

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY

### Daily Verse Curation
- **Selection algorithm:** How are verses chosen each day?
  - Random but avoid repetition?
  - Thematic calendar (seasons, themes)?
  - User personalization (based on interests)?
  - Decision needed from John (spiritual director)

### Guided Journey Development
- **Launch set:** [X] journeys covering key themes
  - Surrender, Longing, Letting Go, Love, Grief, Joy, etc.
- **Ongoing creation:** How many new journeys per quarter?
- **Journey length:** All 5 minutes, or variable?
- **Voice:** Text-only or audio narration? (Impacts design significantly)

### Masnavi Organization
- **Navigation structure:** How do users browse 25,000 verses?
  - By book (Books 1-6)
  - By chapter
  - By theme (love, separation, union, etc.)
  - By life situation (grief, joy, confusion, etc.)
- **Tagging/metadata:** What's needed for search and discovery?
- **Reading plans:** Do we offer structured reading paths?

### Modern Retellings
- **Voice:** First-person (confirmed from deck copy)
- **Length:** Similar to original verse or expanded?
- **Style:** Conversational, poetic, narrative?
- **Attribution:** How do we credit John's work?

---

## REVENUE & GROWTH STRATEGY (Inform Design)

### User Acquisition Channels

**Organic:**
- App Store Optimization (ASO) - Requires great screenshots, compelling copy
- Content marketing - Blog, social media (design needed for posts)
- Word of mouth - Shareable moments in app? (design consideration)

**Paid:**
- Instagram/Facebook ads - Design ad creative
- Google/Apple Search Ads - App preview video needed?
- Podcast sponsorships - Promo codes, landing pages

**Partnerships:**
- Meditation centers, yoga studios, bookstores
- Influencers in spiritual/poetry space
- Coleman Barks (translator) endorsement? (huge if possible)

### Growth Loops
- **Habit loop:** Daily verse → contemplation → return tomorrow
- **Depth loop:** Free verse → desire for journeys → subscribe
- **Content loop:** One poet (Rumi) → desire for others (Hafez) → ecosystem

### Retention Strategy
- **Daily habit:** Gentle notification, not aggressive
- **Depth discovery:** Surface new aspects of Masnavi over time
- **Premium value:** Continuously add new journeys, content
- **No churn tactics:** No guilt, no manipulation, just genuine value

---

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Content Overwhelm
**Problem:** 25,000 verses can paralyze users
**Mitigation:**
- Curated daily verse as default entry point
- Guided journeys provide structure
- Search and themes make library navigable
- Progressive disclosure of depth

### Risk 2: Cultural Appropriation
**Problem:** Western company commodifying Islamic/Sufi tradition
**Mitigation:**
- John's 40+ years in tradition provides authenticity
- Scholarly translations, not New Age interpretations
- Respect for source material in design and copy
- Avoid Orientalist aesthetics (no literal arabesques, "exotic" music, etc.)

### Risk 3: Spiritual Bypass
**Problem:** App becomes "spiritual entertainment" not transformation
**Mitigation:**
- Design for contemplation, not consumption
- No gamification or engagement hacking
- Encourage offline reflection
- "Sanctuary not feed" principle

### Risk 4: Freemium Tension
**Problem:** Paywall disrupts contemplative experience
**Mitigation:**
- Generous free tier (daily verse is core value)
- Premium feels like "going deeper" not "unlocking basics"
- Pricing accessible ($[X]/month is less than a coffee)
- Never manipulative language

### Risk 5: Platform Dependence
**Problem:** Apple/Google policies or fees undermine business
**Mitigation:**
- Build email list (if user consents)
- Consider web app version (future)
- Diversify to Android, not iOS-only
- Plan for platform changes

## INTEGRATION: CONSCIOUS DESIGN FOR CONSCIOUS BUSINESS

### How Design Embodies Corporate Consciousness

**Visual Language of Living Systems:**
- **Self-Organization:** Grid systems and components that allow content to organize naturally
- **Self-Healing:** Design systems that adapt across platforms and use cases
- **Self-Transcendence:** Scalable visual framework that works for Rumi, Hafez, and future poets
- **Self-Replication:** Templates and patterns that can be reproduced with integrity
- **Self-Renewal:** Flexible design that evolves with product iterations

### Design as Meditation on Values

Every design choice reflects organizational consciousness:

| **Design Element** | **Conscious Principle** | **Manifestation** |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Typography (Serif for Rumi) | Respect for tradition | Dignified, timeless presentation |
| White space | Sanctuary over feed | Breathing room, contemplation |
| No gamification | User agency | No manipulation or dark patterns |
| Color palette | Depth + professionalism | Islamic art inspiration + investor credibility |
| Data visualization | Transparency | Clear, honest presentation of business model |
| Team photos | Human connection | Professional yet approachable |
| Rumi illustration | Authentic reverence | Not commodified, genuinely spiritual |

### The Designer's Role in Corporate Evolution

**As Suede, you are not just creating slides or screens. You are:**

1. **Translating consciousness into form** - Making John's integral vision tangible for investors
2. **Building trust through aesthetics** - Showing that spiritual depth and business rigor can coexist
3. **Creating a vessel for transformation** - Designing experiences that facilitate contemplation, not consumption
4. **Establishing visual DNA** - Setting patterns that will replicate across the platform ecosystem
5. **Honoring the sacred** - Ensuring Rumi's teachings are presented with dignity and beauty

### Success Metrics for Conscious Design

**Phase 1 (Deck):**
- Investors feel both inspired AND confident in business viability
- Spiritual integrity maintained while communicating market opportunity
- Design quality signals second-tier organizational consciousness

**Phase 2 (App):**
- Users report feeling "held" by the design, not manipulated
- App facilitates genuine spiritual practice, not addictive scrolling
- Design system enables rapid, quality expansion to new poets
- Accessibility demonstrates commitment to inclusive well-being

*This PRD is a living document. As we learn more through design exploration, user feedback, and stakeholder input, it will evolve. The Rumi App is ultimately a sacred technology project — we're building a vessel for timeless wisdom to reach modern seekers. We're also building a Corporate Conscious Self with the power to channel resources and wisdom toward healing the world's meaning crisis. Let's build it with integrity, beauty, and systems thinking.*
