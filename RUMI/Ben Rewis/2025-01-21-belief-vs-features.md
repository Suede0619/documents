# Belief vs Features Framework

From Ben Rewis, Jan 21, 2025

## Key Insight

Belief is what gets investors, customers, and teammates to care; features are just how the belief is delivered today. The more your startup sells a clear, emotionally resonant story about a better future and your unique way of getting there, the less you get trapped competing on checklists and incremental app features.

## Belief vs Features Hierarchy

- **Feature**: What your product does (e.g., "1-click sharing," "AI scoring")
- **Benefit**: What users get from that (e.g., "saves you 3 hours a week")
- **Belief**: What they must accept for the benefit to matter (e.g., "time is my scarcest asset; I should automate anything repeatable")

If you only talk features, you invite comparison with every competitor; if you lead with belief, you define the game people think they're playing.

## Core Beliefs You Need to Sell

For an early-stage startup, the key beliefs usually cluster around:

1. **The problem**: "This problem is urgent, expensive, and overlooked by current solutions."
2. **The future**: "There is a different, better way to live/work if we change our approach."
3. **The category**: "The old category is broken; this new category is the right lens."
4. **The team**: "This founding team is uniquely qualified to make that future real."

Features then become proof points that your worldview is executable, not the main event.

## How to Build and Communicate Belief

### Craft a Vivid Product Vision Story

- Tell a concrete story of a future day-in-the-life with your product in it, showing how a specific person's world is transformed, not which buttons they tap
- Highlight the emotional payoff (relief, confidence, status, freedom) alongside functional outcomes (time saved, revenue gained)

### Articulate a Sharp Point of View (POV)

- Name what's broken in the old way and why it will get worse if people stay there
- Coin language for the new way: a named problem, a named practice, even a named category, so people can repeat your story when you're not in the room

### Use Your Pitch as "The Product"

- Treat your deck, landing page, and narrative as the first product users experience; they must change how people think before they ever log in
- Make every demo start with context and stakes ("Here's what's happening in your world and why it will crush you if you don't adapt") before clicking through UI

## Avoiding the "Feature Factory" Trap

- Don't treat every customer request as a roadmap item; map requests against your vision and core beliefs, and say no to anything that dilutes them
- Anchor metrics and success stories in outcomes (NPS, retention, revenue lift, time saved) rather than raw feature count or velocity
- Use "strong opinions, loosely held": have clear beliefs about the model and category, then update them with real customer evidence instead of chasing a laundry list

## Reframing Exercise for Your Startup

Take your current app and:

1. List top 5 features and the benefit of each
2. For each, write the underlying belief a user must hold to care about that benefit (e.g., "I should systematize my client work, not improvise it")
3. Rewrite your homepage, pitch, and demo to start from those beliefs and the future story, then show 1–2 features as proof you can deliver it
