# Rumi App Strategy Session with Ben Rewis

Wed, 21 Jan 2025

## Startup Belief Strategy vs Features

- Ben emphasized that VCs need to believe in your mission, not just features
  - Features are what product does ("1-click sharing," "AI scoring")
  - Benefits are what users get ("saves 3 hours a week")
  - Belief is what they must accept for benefit to matter ("time is scarcest asset")
- Leading with belief defines the game rather than inviting feature comparison
- Core beliefs needed for early-stage startups:
  1. The problem is urgent, expensive, overlooked
  2. Different, better way to live/work exists
  3. Old category broken; new category is right lens
  4. Founding team uniquely qualified to deliver

## Rumi App Category Positioning

- Identified "spiritual companion apps" as new category (3 words - right length)
  - Positioned alongside spiritual famine in modern world
  - People emotionally malnourished, disconnected, overwhelmed
  - Seekers leaving religion/politics/science, seeking own truth
- Global trend: people want spiritual connection without dogma of deity
- Rumi app as first emotionally intelligent guide to Rumi's teachings
- Mission: help seekers navigate mystery of being human by rekindling spirit connection

## Product Demo Feedback

- Ben impressed with current app development
  - AI translations of entire Masnavi corpus
  - Reimagined poetry as first-person parables
  - Individual quotes as gateways to stories
  - Guided journeys (grief, love topics) with daily notifications
- Compared favorably to WeCreak app from Bhutan (impermanence quotes)
- Emphasized need for dopamine rush model like Facebook alerts
- Recommended AI as new UI, voice/visual replacing text

## Organizational Process Requirements

- Must formalize product owner role (CPO function)
  - Controls MVP iterations based on customer feedback
  - Makes trade-off calls on feature/function loading
- Implement release train methodology:
  1. Weekly Thursday releases (MVP n+1)
  2. Friday beta testing (A/B/C groups)
  3. Monday feedback integration
  4. Tuesday product release discussion
  5. Wednesday QA by team
- Need RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
  - One person accountable per task ("throat to choke")
  - Will drive org chart and hiring strategy

## Business Model & Pricing

- Freemium model: partial translations with subscription prompt
- Premium subscription: $9.99/month (not $8.99 as originally planned)
  - All Masnavi access, AI images, quotes, guided journeys
  - 20% discount for annual payment
- Comparable to Headspace, Waking Up, Pattern app pricing
- No ads to avoid disrupting contemplation experience

## Financial Planning Requirements

- Ben strongly recommended cash flow forecast as top priority
- Needs weighted sales forecast (probability × revenue amount)
- Monthly burn rate analysis against cash on hand
- Must show fiscal gap requiring investor funding
- All team members must understand sales and expenses monthly
- Will enable proper series A planning (typically 2 years runway)

## Scaling & Investment Strategy

- Need demand-based hiring strategy tied to RACI
- Org chart showing current team + projected hires post-series A
- Job descriptions and reporting structure required
- Strategy drives structure drives people (never reverse)
- Ben available as behind-scenes advisor until D&O insurance obtained
- Will help prepare for VC "proctological exam" due diligence
