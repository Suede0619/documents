# Role Fit Analysis: Marketing Lead vs. Product Owner

Rumi App — Stuart and Yalor Role Comparison  
Prepared: January 26, 2026  
Status: Internal Working Document

---

## Purpose

The team currently has two unfilled leadership functions pre-seed: **Marketing Lead** and **Product Owner**. Yalor is assigned as interim PO (per Doc 07). No one owns marketing execution. This document compares both Stuart and Yalor's qualifications for each role to determine the optimal assignment.

## The Two Roles

### Marketing Lead — What It Requires Pre-Seed

| Responsibility | Priority | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Brand identity and design system | Critical | The app's visual identity IS the first impression |
| Pitch deck and investor materials | Critical | Must convert investor meetings to checks |
| Landing page and web presence | Critical | Lead capture, credibility |
| App Store presence (screenshots, preview, description) | Critical | Conversion optimization at point of download |
| Social media content and community building | High | Audience building before launch |
| Guerrilla marketing and grassroots outreach | High | Low-budget, high-impact pre-funding |
| Marketing strategy and positioning | High | Category design, messaging, target audience |
| PR and press outreach | Medium | Relationships with wellness/spiritual publications |
| Paid acquisition (Meta Ads, Google UAC, Apple Search Ads) | Low pre-seed | Requires budget — post-funding priority |
| Analytics and attribution (CAC, ROAS, channel performance) | Low pre-seed | Meaningful only with paid spend and user volume |
| ASO (App Store Optimization) | Medium | Keyword research can start pre-launch |
| Email marketing and nurture sequences | Medium | List building from landing page |

### Product Owner — What It Requires Pre-Seed

| Responsibility | Priority | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Feature prioritization and backlog management | Critical | What gets built first, second, never |
| Sprint scope and planning | Critical | Weekly cadence per Doc 06 release train |
| Beta feedback loop management | Critical | Translating user feedback into actionable tickets |
| Stakeholder alignment (balancing John's vision, Todd's capacity, business goals) | Critical | The PO is the negotiator between competing priorities |
| KPI ownership (DAU, retention, NPS, conversion) | High | Defining and tracking success metrics |
| User research coordination | High | Who to talk to, what to ask, how to synthesize |
| Technical communication with CTO | High | Speaking Todd's language — tickets, acceptance criteria, tradeoffs |
| Roadmap management | High | Sequencing features across quarters |
| Sprint ceremonies (standups, retros, demos) | Medium | Process facilitation |
| Go/no-go release decisions | Medium | Quality gate before each Thursday release |
| Competitive feature analysis | Medium | What are Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer doing? |

## Stuart as Marketing Lead

### Strengths — Why This Fits

1. **Already doing the work.** Stuart built the pitch deck (31 hours), the landing page (8.5 hours), and produced all investor-ready VAULT documents. The marketing function is not theoretical — it's demonstrated.

2. **Brand ownership is natural.** As CDO, Stuart owns the design system, visual identity, and brand voice. Marketing is the outward expression of brand. Having one person own both eliminates the #1 source of startup marketing dysfunction: brand inconsistency between design and campaigns.

3. **3-in-1 creative execution.** Stuart can design a social media campaign, build the landing page for it, and create the visual assets — without coordinating across three people. This is a significant speed advantage pre-seed when there's no budget for agencies or freelancers.

4. **Guerrilla marketing and events.** Stuart has stated experience producing dinners, gatherings, and grassroots events. Pre-seed marketing for a spiritual app is not about paid ads — it's about community building, word-of-mouth, and authentic outreach. This is exactly Stuart's wheelhouse.

5. **Sales capability.** Self-described ability to sell. Marketing at the pre-seed stage is partly sales — selling the vision to early adopters, beta testers, influencers, and community partners.

6. **AI-augmented productivity.** Stuart authored all VAULT documents using AI. This same capability applies to content marketing: blog posts, email sequences, social copy, press pitches. One person with strong AI skills can produce marketing content at the volume of a small team.

7. **Contemplative practice authenticity.** Decades of practice means Stuart understands the audience from the inside. Marketing to spiritual seekers requires genuine understanding — not wellness buzzwords. Stuart can write and design from lived experience.

### Gaps — What's Missing

1. **Paid acquisition experience.** No demonstrated experience running Meta Ads, Google UAC, or Apple Search Ads. This is a post-funding skill gap — not critical pre-seed.

2. **Analytics and attribution.** No evidence of CAC tracking, ROAS optimization, or funnel analysis. Can be learned or hired for post-funding.

3. **PR and press relationships.** PR is listed as a support skill but no evidence of media placements or journalist relationships in the wellness/spiritual space.

4. **ASO (App Store Optimization).** Keyword research, A/B testing descriptions, review management — learnable but not a current skill.

### Verdict: Strong Fit

**8/10.** Stuart covers the high-priority pre-seed marketing needs (brand, materials, landing page, community, content) and has gaps only in areas that require budget (paid ads) or become critical post-launch (analytics, ASO). The gaps are fillable: the Marketing Specialist hire (Q3 2026 per Doc 05) will cover paid acquisition and analytics.

## Stuart as Product Owner

### Strengths — Why There's a Case

1. **UX/UI expertise feeds directly into product decisions.** A PO who can wireframe a feature before writing a ticket saves significant back-and-forth with engineering. Stuart can sketch, prototype, and validate concepts in Figma before they hit Todd's sprint.

2. **User research experience.** Candidate profile lists user interviews, feedback analysis, and usability testing. The PO needs to synthesize user feedback — Stuart has the methodology.

3. **Deep user empathy.** Years of contemplative practice, lived in ashrams, managed a retreat center. Stuart understands what spiritual seekers need, what feels sacred vs. transactional, and where the line between accessibility and appropriation sits. This is product judgment, not just design taste.

4. **Multi-stakeholder management.** Managed cross-cultural teams at Mystical Yoga Farm. The PO role requires balancing John's spiritual vision, Todd's technical constraints, Yalor's business goals, and user needs. Stuart has experience navigating competing priorities in complex environments.

5. **AI-augmented documentation.** PO work involves writing user stories, acceptance criteria, and feature specs. Stuart's AI productivity could accelerate this work significantly.

### Gaps — What's Missing

1. **No sprint management experience.** No evidence of running standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, or managing a product backlog in any tool (Jira, Linear, ClickUp). This is a core PO skill, not a nice-to-have.

2. **No backlog/prioritization framework experience.** PO must make hard tradeoff decisions: this feature vs. that feature, this sprint vs. next sprint. Requires comfort with frameworks like RICE, MoSCoW, or weighted scoring. No evidence of this.

3. **No KPI ownership experience.** PO owns metrics: DAU, D1/D7/D30 retention, conversion rate, NPS. No evidence of defining, tracking, or being accountable to product metrics.

4. **Technical communication gap with Todd.** The PO needs to speak engineering language: acceptance criteria, edge cases, API contracts, technical debt tradeoffs. Stuart's technical background is WordPress/frontend, not native iOS/Swift. There will be a translation gap with Todd that could slow sprint velocity.

5. **No release management experience.** The PO makes go/no-go decisions on weekly releases (per Doc 06). This requires understanding build stability, crash rates, regression risks — areas outside Stuart's demonstrated experience.

6. **Startup product cadence is new.** No evidence of working in a fast-paced, weekly-release product development cycle. The retreat center and freelance design work are different operational rhythms.

### Verdict: Moderate Fit

**5/10.** Stuart brings valuable design-side product skills (UX research, prototyping, user empathy) but lacks the operational core of the PO role (sprint management, backlog grooming, metrics ownership, technical negotiation with engineering). This could be learned, but it's a steeper ramp than marketing.

---

## Yalor as Marketing Lead

### Strengths — Why There's a Case

1. **Strategy ownership.** Doc 05 assigns Yalor "marketing strategy oversight" as part of the COO role. Strategy is the highest-leverage marketing activity — deciding where to invest, which channels to pursue, how to position the product.

2. **Fundraising is marketing.** Selling the company to investors uses the same skills as selling the product to users: storytelling, positioning, audience targeting, conversion. Yalor's fundraising experience translates to marketing thinking.

3. **Network and partnerships.** Yalor's stated network of collaborators, operators, and funders is a marketing asset. Partnerships (wellness influencers, spiritual communities, retreat centers, podcast hosts) are a high-ROI pre-seed marketing channel.

4. **Startup scaling experience.** Scaled a DeFi company — likely involved growth strategy, community building, and user acquisition in some capacity.

5. **Community building background.** Co-founded a community and wellness hub. Community-led growth is arguably the right pre-seed marketing strategy for a spiritual app.

### Gaps — What's Missing

1. **No creative execution capability.** Yalor cannot design a pitch deck, create social media graphics, build a landing page, or produce brand assets. All marketing output requires Stuart (or a hire) for execution.

2. **No design or brand skills.** Cannot maintain brand consistency across touchpoints — needs to rely on Stuart for all visual/brand work.

3. **No content creation evidence.** No demonstrated ability to write marketing copy, blog posts, email sequences, or social media content.

4. **No paid acquisition experience.** Same gap as Stuart — no evidence of running ad campaigns.

5. **No ASO or app marketing experience.** App Store marketing is a specialized discipline.

6. **Strategy without execution is incomplete.** Pre-seed, the team cannot afford a strategy-only marketing role. Someone needs to produce the actual marketing materials, run the social accounts, build the email list, and execute grassroots outreach. Yalor's profile is strategy-heavy, execution-light.

### Verdict: Moderate Fit (Strategy Only)

**5/10.** Yalor can own marketing strategy and partnerships, but cannot execute marketing deliverables. Pre-seed, execution matters more than strategy — you need someone who can actually produce the work, not just direct it. Yalor as marketing lead would still require Stuart to do all the actual marketing work.

## Yalor as Product Owner

### Strengths — Why This Fits

1. **Already assigned the role.** Doc 07 (PO Charter) designates Yalor as interim PO. The team has already agreed to this assignment.

2. **Startup operational experience.** 10+ years in startups, scaled a DeFi company. This likely involved working with engineering teams, managing product backlogs, and making build-vs-skip decisions under resource constraints.

3. **Business operations background.** COO role includes process management, financial oversight, and cross-functional coordination — all PO-adjacent skills. The PO is essentially the operational bridge between business goals and engineering output.

4. **Financial modeling and prioritization.** Fundraising and financial management require the same analytical thinking as feature prioritization: ROI analysis, resource allocation, opportunity cost assessment.

5. **Stakeholder management.** Non-profit and foundation experience involves managing boards, donors, and diverse stakeholders — similar to the PO's role of balancing founder vision, engineering constraints, and user needs.

6. **Sprint cadence comfort.** Startup experience likely includes working in sprints or similar iterative cycles. The weekly release train (Doc 06) is a natural fit for someone who's operated in fast-paced startup environments.

7. **Fundraising context informs product.** The PO decides what gets built. Yalor, as the person closest to investors, knows what investors want to see in the product. This alignment between fundraising narrative and product roadmap is valuable.

### Gaps — What's Missing

1. **No design or UX skills.** Cannot wireframe, prototype, or evaluate design quality. Will depend entirely on Stuart for the visual/UX side of product decisions.

2. **No stated technical background.** The DeFi company may have been a non-technical role. Unclear how comfortable Yalor is with engineering tradeoffs, technical debt conversations, or acceptance criteria writing.

3. **Spiritual practice depth is unclear.** The PO for a spiritual app needs to understand what makes a feature feel sacred vs. generic. Yalor's wellness hub experience is relevant, but Stuart's long contemplative practice background provides deeper product intuition for this specific domain.

4. **Dual role strain.** Yalor is COO + PO + fundraising lead. That's three demanding jobs. PO requires deep focus — attending to user feedback, grooming the backlog, writing detailed stories. If Yalor is pulled into investor meetings and operational fires, PO work will suffer.

### Verdict: Good Fit

**7/10.** Yalor has the operational and startup experience to run the PO function effectively. The main risks are dual-role strain (COO + PO + fundraising is a lot) and the lack of design/UX skills (mitigated by Stuart's CDO role).

## Recommended Assignment

| Role | Best Fit | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Marketing Lead** | **Stuart** | Already executing 80% of the work. Can produce all deliverables without dependency on others. Design + brand + content + community is a natural bundle. Gaps (paid ads, analytics) are post-funding concerns. |
| **Product Owner** | **Yalor** | Startup operational experience, likely sprint-comfortable, closer to investor/business context. Gaps (design, UX) are covered by Stuart as CDO. |

### Why There's No Separate Product Manager Hire

Doc 05 (Job Descriptions) does not list a Product Manager in the hiring plan. That's intentional — at a 4-founder startup, the PO function is distributed:

- **Yalor** runs the release train cadence, sprint scope, backlog, KPIs, and go/no-go decisions
- **Todd** owns the technical release (Thursday builds) and QA
- **Stuart** owns design QA, UX research input, and visual sign-off
- **John** owns content quality and spiritual integrity sign-off

There is no need for a dedicated PM hire until the team scales significantly (post-Series A, 10+ people). The release train (Doc 06) is a **shared cadence, not one person's job**. The PO is the conductor, but every founder has a station.

### Stuart's Role in the Release Train (Without PO Title)

Even with Yalor as PO, Stuart has a critical product role in the weekly cadence:

| Day | Stuart's Responsibility |
|-----|----------------------|
| Thursday | Review build for visual/design issues before wider beta release |
| Friday | Monitor beta feedback for UX/design-related complaints |
| Monday | Attend triage — flag design debt, propose UX solutions for reported issues |
| Tuesday | Participate in sprint scope — advocate for design quality, estimate design work |
| Wednesday | **Lead design QA** — visual consistency, brand adherence, interaction quality, accessibility |

**No screen ships without Stuart's design sign-off.** This is a meaningful product authority even without the PO title. The CDO is the design gate in the release train.

### How They Work Together

The optimal structure is **Stuart owns marketing, Yalor owns product, and they collaborate on the overlap:**

```
                    JOHN (Content/Vision)
                           |
                    TODD (Engineering)
                           |
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              |                         |
        YALOR (IPO)               STUART (CDO + IML)
     - Sprint scope              - Brand & design system
     - Backlog mgmt              - Investor materials
     - Feature priorities        - Landing page & web
     - KPIs & metrics            - Social & community
     - Release go/no-go          - App Store presence
     - Stakeholder balance       - Guerrilla marketing & events
     - Beta feedback synthesis   - Design QA in release train
              |                  - UX research (leads)
              |                         |
              └──────── OVERLAP ────────┘
                  - UX research: Stuart leads research,
                    Yalor synthesizes into backlog
                  - User feedback: Yalor collects from beta,
                    Stuart designs solutions
                  - Launch strategy: co-owned
                  - Marketing ←→ Product alignment
                  - Wednesday QA: both participate,
                    Stuart focuses on design quality
```

### The Strategic Advice: Don't Compete, Complement

If the question is "should Stuart take PO to justify more equity?" — the answer is **no, taking marketing lead is the stronger play.**

- **Marketing lead is an unoccupied domain.** PO is occupied (Yalor). Taking PO from Yalor creates conflict. Taking marketing creates value.
- **Stuart already has product authority** through design QA and UX research in the release train — without needing the PO title.
- **The equity parity argument is cleaner with complementary roles**, not competing for the same one.
- **Pre-seed, marketing execution is the bigger gap.** The team has a PO. It has zero marketing execution. Filling the gap is more valuable than duplicating coverage.

### Why This Matters for Equity

If Stuart formally owns **marketing lead** in addition to CDO:
- Stuart owns two strategic domains (design + marketing) vs. Yalor's two (operations + product)
- Stuart also holds design authority in the release train (product contribution without PO title)
- The scope is equivalent, not 2:1
- The equity argument for parity (or near-parity) becomes straightforward
- Both are doing the work of 2+ roles with no salary

This is the strongest argument against the 17/9 split and in favor of something closer to 17/17 or 18/16.
