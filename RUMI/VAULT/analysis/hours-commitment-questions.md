# Hours & Commitment Clarification Questions

Rumi App — Founder Hours Audit & Going-Forward Commitment  
Prepared: January 26, 2026  
Status: Internal Working Document — Action Required from All Founders

---

## Purpose

The following questions must be answered by each founder before the equity split can be finalized. Accurate, honest answers are essential for a fair allocation and for presenting a credible cap table to investors.

Currently, Stuart is the only founder with category-tracked hours. The team needs a shared standard of accountability before equity percentages are locked in.

## Questions for Yalor Mewn

14. **Historical hours:** How many hours have you put in since joining (~1 month)? Can you provide a category breakdown? (e.g., meetings, fundraising outreach, operations setup, document creation, strategy)

16. **Going-forward commitment:** What is your planned weekly commitment through launch and beyond?

## Questions for Stuart Paul

19. **Current commitment:** Beyond the tracked 58.5 hours, how many hours per week are you currently committing?
20. **Going-forward commitment:** What is your planned weekly commitment through launch and beyond?
21. **Role scope:** Are you willing to take on additional responsibilities (PO, marketing execution, frontend development) that would justify equity parity with Yalor?
22. **Tergar conflict:** You have a concurrent Tergar Retreats engagement (Jan-Dec 2026, ~$29K). How will you balance both commitments? What percentage of your working hours go to Rumi vs. Tergar?

## Questions for the Entire Team

23. **Definition of full-time:** What does each founder consider "full-time" commitment? 40 hrs/week? 50? 60? This should be aligned.
24. **Milestone-based vesting:** Should vesting be purely time-based (4 years / 1 year cliff) or should there be milestone-based acceleration? (e.g., extra vesting credit for hitting launch, first 1,000 users, $100K ARR)
25. **Hours tracking standard:** Will all founders adopt a shared time-tracking tool (e.g., Toggl, Harvest, or a simple shared spreadsheet) to ensure transparency and accountability?
26. **Commitment ramp:** Is there an agreed timeline for when each founder goes from part-time/half-time to full-time? Does equity allocation change if someone doesn't increase commitment as planned?
27. **What happens if commitment doesn't match expectations?** If a founder commits to 20 hrs/week but consistently delivers 10, what recourse do the other founders have? This should be addressed in the founder agreement (Doc 10).

*These questions should be discussed openly in a founder meeting. Answers should be documented and referenced when finalizing the equity split in [Doc 09 — Cap Table](../09-cap-table.md) and [Doc 10 — Team Governance](../10-team-governance.md).*
