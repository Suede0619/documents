# Pre-Seed Timeline, Design Scope & Launch Plan

Rumi App — What to Build, When to Build It, and When to Launch  
Prepared: January 26, 2026  
Status: Internal Working Document

---

## Overview

This document answers four interconnected questions:
1. How much design is needed right now? Are wireframes enough?
2. When does the app need to work and be designed?
3. How much UX research goes in before the seed round?
4. When is launch — before or after seed?

**Short answers:**
- Wireframes are the correct deliverable right now — high-fidelity designs are premature.
- The app does not need to work before seed. It needs to work before beta (~Jul 2026).
- Lightweight UX research (5-10 conversations) before seed. Formal research post-funding.
- Launch is after seed. Target: Sep-Oct 2026.

## 1. Design Scope: What's Needed at Each Stage

| Stage | Design Deliverable | Fidelity | Purpose |
|-------|-------------------|----------|---------|
| **Now (pre-seed, pre-funding)** | Wireframes + user flows | Low-to-mid fidelity | Show investors you've thought through the product |
| **Pitch deck** | 3-5 app mockup screens | Mid fidelity | Sell the vision — does it *look* like something people would use? |
| **Post-funding, pre-beta** | Full UI design system | High fidelity | Todd needs pixel-perfect specs to build from |
| **Beta launch** | Complete screen designs | High fidelity | Real users, real app |
| **Public launch** | Polished + App Store assets | Production quality | Screenshots, preview video, icon |

### Why Wireframes Are the Right Deliverable Now

- **Lean methodology.** Build the minimum to validate, then invest. YC preaches this.
- **Wireframes invite feedback.** High-fidelity designs look "done" and people hesitate to critique them. Wireframes look like work-in-progress and invite honest input.
- **Todd can start building from wireframes.** He doesn't need pixel-perfect designs to build a functional prototype. Wireframes + a basic style guide is enough for a beta.
- **You'll learn more from 10 user conversations than from 50 polished screens.** UX research should inform the design, not follow it.
- **The product will change.** After user research and beta feedback, screens will be redesigned. Full high-fidelity work now means rework later.

### What Would Be Wasted Effort Right Now

- Full high-fidelity designs for every screen
- A design system with components and tokens (premature — need to know what you're building before systematizing how it looks)
- Interaction design and animations (Todd needs a working build first)
- Multiple design options for stakeholder review (pre-seed, move fast — one strong direction, iterate from feedback)

### Recommended Design Scope — Now Through Seed

| Deliverable | Est. Hours | Priority | Owner |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Core user flow wireframes (5-8 screens) | 8-12 hrs | Critical — for pitch deck and team alignment | Stuart |
| 3-5 mid-fidelity hero mockups | 6-10 hrs | Critical — for pitch deck | Stuart |
| Basic brand system (colors, typography, spacing) | 4-6 hrs | High — establishes visual language | Stuart |
| App icon concept | 2-3 hrs | Medium — needed for pitch deck | Stuart |
| **Total** | **20-31 hrs** | | |

Everything else (full design system, all screens, App Store assets, preview video) comes **after funding**.

## 2. UX Research: How Much Before Seed?

### Three Phases of UX Research

| Phase | When | What | Volume | Who |
|-------|------|------|--------|-----|
| **Pre-seed (NOW)** | Jan-Mar 2026 | Informal conversations with spiritual seekers. What apps do they use? What's missing? Would they pay for a Rumi-focused app? How do they engage with Rumi today? | 5-10 conversations | Stuart + Yalor |
| **Post-funding, pre-beta** | Apr-Jun 2026 | Structured user interviews. Test wireframes. Validate content formats. Identify must-have vs. nice-to-have features. | 15-20 interviews | Stuart + UI/UX hire |
| **Beta** | Jul-Sep 2026 | In-app feedback, beta surveys (per Doc 06), analytics (Mixpanel). Actual usage data — the real UX research. | 100-150 beta users | Yalor (PO) + Stuart |

### What Investors Want to Hear Pre-Seed

- "We've talked to 10 spiritual seekers and here's what we learned..."
- "8 out of 10 said they'd pay for a dedicated Rumi experience"
- "The #1 pain point is that existing apps feel generic, not spiritually grounded"

You don't need a formal UX research report. You need **signal** — evidence that real people want this. Even 5 conversations documented in a one-pager adds credibility to the pitch.

### What to Ask in Pre-Seed Conversations

1. Do you currently use any meditation or spiritual apps? Which ones?
2. What do you like and dislike about them?
3. How do you currently engage with Rumi's poetry or Sufi teachings?
4. If there were a dedicated Rumi spiritual companion app, what would you want in it?
5. Would you pay $9.99/month for that experience?

| **SAFE closes ($250K)** | **Apr-May 2026** | **Investor says yes** | Not started |
| Hire UI/UX Designer | May-Jun 2026 | Funding in bank | Not started |
| Hire Marketing Specialist | May-Jun 2026 | Funding in bank | Not started |
| Todd goes full-time | May 2026 | Funding (stipends start) | Not started |
| Full UI design system complete | Jun-Jul 2026 | Stuart + UI/UX hire | Not started |
| Beta build on TestFlight | Jul-Aug 2026 | Todd delivers build | Not started |
| Release train starts | ~Jun 2026 | Per Doc 06 | Not started |
| Beta testing (3 groups, 100-150 users) | Jul-Sep 2026 | Beta build ready | Not started |
| **iOS public launch** | **Sep-Oct 2026** | Beta feedback integrated | Not started |
| Android launch | Q4 2026-Q1 2027 | Series A or Android hire | Not started |

### Why Launch Must Be After Seed

- **$0 bank balance.** Nobody is getting paid. Todd is building half-time.
- **You need the $250K to:** pay stipends so founders go full-time, hire UI/UX + marketing, fund infrastructure (Apple Developer, hosting, tools), and fund initial marketing spend.
- **Without funding, the project stays at half-time hobby pace indefinitely.**

### The Critical Path

The thing that determines *everything* is: **when does the SAFE close?**

| Scenario | SAFE Closes | Launch Date | Risk |
|----------|------------|-------------|------|
| Optimistic | April 2026 | Sep-Oct 2026 | Low — tight but achievable |
| Realistic | May-June 2026 | Nov-Dec 2026 | Medium — holiday launch could help or hurt |
| Delayed | Jul+ 2026 | Q1 2027 | High — momentum loss, team fatigue |
| No funding | Never | Never | Project stalls at $0 with part-time commitment |

## 4. What Stuart Should Be Working On Right Now

Given the timeline, Stuart's highest-value work ranked by impact on the fundraise:

| Priority | Deliverable | Impact | Est. Hours |
|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Wireframes (5-8 key screens) | Goes directly into pitch deck — without this, the deck has a hole | 8-12 |
| 2 | 3-5 mid-fidelity hero mockups | The "wow" moment in the pitch — investors need to *feel* the product | 6-10 |
| 3 | 5 user conversations (documented) | "We've validated demand" vs. "we think people want this" | 5-8 |
| 4 | Landing page optimization for email signups | Even 100-200 signups pre-seed is signal | 3-5 |
| 5 | Basic brand system (colors, type, spacing) | Foundation for all visual work going forward | 4-6 |
| 6 | App icon concept | Needed for pitch deck and brand identity | 2-3 |
| **Total** | | | **28-44 hrs** |

These deliverables position Stuart as indispensable to the fundraise — not just "the designer" but the person who produced the materials that got the check.
