# Founder Role Qualification Assessment

Rumi App - Pre-Seed Hard Topics Exercise  
January 27, 2026

---

## Purpose

This document is a self-assessment exercise for every co-founder. It is not a performance review, a vote of confidence, or a threat. It is a tool.

Early-stage startups fail most often because of founder misalignment — not because of bad ideas or weak markets. The teams that survive are the ones willing to ask uncomfortable questions before a crisis forces them to.

This exercise asks each founder to honestly evaluate their own fitness for the role they currently hold. No one is grading you. The answers are for you first, your co-founders second, and the company third.

Every question in this document applies to every founder equally. If a question makes you defensive, that is worth noticing.

---

## How to Use This Document

1. Each founder completes their own section privately
2. Take at least 24 hours — do not rush through it
3. Bring your completed answers to a dedicated Founder Sync meeting
4. Each person reads their own answers aloud, without interruption
5. After all four have shared, open discussion begins
6. The goal is not consensus — it is honesty

**Ground rules for the discussion:**
- No one comments on another founder's self-assessment until all four have been read
- "I don't know" is a valid answer
- Defensiveness is natural; notice it, name it, continue
- Nothing said in this exercise changes anyone's role or equity without a separate, formal decision

## Part 1: Role Clarity

Answer these questions about the role you currently hold.

### 1.1 — What is my role, and what does it actually require?

Write out — in your own words, not copied from the job description — what your role demands day to day, week to week, and quarter to quarter.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 1.2 — What are the three most important skills this role requires right now, at pre-seed stage?

Not in general. Not at Series A. Right now, in the next 90 days, what three skills matter most?

_Your answer:_

1.
2.
3.

### 1.3 — What will this role require in 12 months that it does not require today?

How will the demands change as the company grows from 4 people to 10, from pre-seed to post-funding?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

---

## Part 2: Honest Self-Assessment

### 2.1 — Do I have the three skills I listed above?

For each skill you named in 1.2, rate yourself honestly:

| Skill | Strong | Adequate | Developing | Lacking |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| 1. | | | | |
| 2. | | | | |
| 3. | | | | |

### 2.2 — What is my biggest gap?

Every founder has one. Name yours. Not a humble-brag weakness ("I work too hard"). A real gap that, if left unaddressed, could hurt the company.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 2.3 — What am I doing to close that gap?

Specific actions. Not intentions, not plans — what have you actually done in the last 30 days to address your biggest weakness?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 2.4 — If I were hiring for this role externally, would I hire myself?

Be brutally honest. Would your resume, your track record, and your current output win this role in a competitive search? Why or why not?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

---

## Part 3: Commitment and Capacity

### 3.1 — How many hours per week am I actually working on the Rumi App?

Not aspirational hours. Actual hours over the last 4 weeks. Track it if you have not been.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 3.2 — Is my current commitment level sufficient for what the role demands?

Given what you wrote in Part 1, is the time you are putting in enough?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 3.3 — What else am I doing with my time?

Other jobs, freelance work, personal projects, family obligations, health issues — anything that competes for the same hours and energy. No judgment. Just honesty.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 3.4 — Can I increase my commitment if the company needs it?

If the next 6 months require significantly more from you — can you give it? What would have to change for that to happen?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

---

## Part 4: Execution Check

### 4.1 — What have I shipped in the last 30 days?

List concrete deliverables. Not meetings attended, not ideas discussed — things that exist now that did not exist 30 days ago because of your work.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 4.2 — Am I waiting for others, or are others waiting for me?

Where am I a blocker? Where am I blocked? Be specific.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 4.3 — Am I taking initiative or waiting for direction?

Founders take initiative. Employees wait for direction. Which pattern describes your last 30 days more accurately?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 4.4 — Am I using the best available tools and methods?

Is there a faster, better, or more efficient way I could be working? Am I resistant to new tools, processes, or approaches? Why?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

## Part 5: The Hard Questions

These are the questions most founders avoid. Avoiding them does not make them go away — it just means they surface during a crisis instead of before one.

### 5.1 — Am I the right person for this role?

Not "do I deserve this role" or "did I earn this role." The question is: given what the company needs right now and in the next 12 months, am I the best person the company could have in this seat?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 5.2 — If the answer is "not yet" — what would make me the right person?

What specific skills, habits, or changes would close the gap? Is that realistic in the timeframe the company needs?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 5.3 — Could someone else do this role better?

This is not a trick question. In most startups, the founding team is the team you have, not the team you would draft. But being honest about where a hire, advisor, or role change could strengthen the company is a sign of maturity, not weakness.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 5.4 — Would I be willing to change roles if it served the company?

If the team concluded that you would be more effective in a different seat — or that your current seat needed a different person — how would you respond? Be honest about your ego, your identity, and your flexibility.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 5.5 — Under what circumstances would I step back from my current role?

This is not about being pushed out. This is about knowing your own limits. What conditions — personal, professional, or company-related — would lead you to say "someone else should lead this"?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 5.6 — What does "stepping back" look like to me?

If you did change roles, what would you want that to look like? A different title? An advisory role? Reduced hours? Full departure? There is no wrong answer — but there is value in knowing your own answer before the question is forced.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

## Part 6: Role-Specific Reflections

Each founder should answer the questions under their own role. Read the other roles' questions too — they may prompt useful thinking.

### CEO / Spiritual Director

- Can you run a board meeting, manage investor expectations, and make hard operational calls — or is your strength primarily in vision and content?
- Are you organized enough to lead a company, or do you need a strong operational partner to function at your best?
- How do you handle conflict between the spiritual mission and business demands? Can you make revenue-driven decisions when needed?
- Do team members come to you for leadership and direction, or do they work around you?
- If the company needed a professional CEO at Series A, would you champion that hire — or resist it?

### CTO

- Are you building at the pace the company needs, or is perfectionism slowing you down?
- Are you leveraging every tool available — including AI-assisted development — to move faster?
- Can you architect and ship a product with a small team under startup constraints, or are you more suited to a larger engineering organization?
- Are you taking technical ownership proactively, or waiting for product direction before acting?
- If the company needed to hire a VP of Engineering above you, would you support that — or see it as a demotion?

### COO / IPO

- Are you spending your time on the highest-leverage activities (fundraising, strategy, investor relations) or getting pulled into operational details?
- Can you balance the product owner role with business operations, or is one suffering?
- Do you have the financial modeling and fundraising skills to close a $250K round, or do you need support?
- Are you making decisions quickly enough, or does your process slow the team down?
- If the company brought in a professional COO or Head of Operations at Series A, would you transition gracefully to a focused product or strategy role?

### CDO / IML

- Are you shipping design work at the pace the company needs, or are you spread too thin across design, marketing, and operational work?
- Is your design output at the quality level that will impress investors and convert users?
- Can you execute a marketing strategy — not just create assets, but run campaigns, measure results, and iterate?
- Are you taking ownership of the brand as a business asset, or treating design as a service function?
- If the company hired a Head of Design or a Head of Marketing, which role would you want to keep — and which would you hand off?

## Part 7: What I Need From My Co-Founders

This section is about what you need from the rest of the team to do your best work. It is also about what you are not getting.

### 7.1 — What do I need from each co-founder that I am not currently receiving?

Be specific and constructive. "More communication" is too vague. "A weekly 15-minute check-in on content delivery status" is actionable.

| Co-Founder | What I Need | What I Am Getting |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### 7.2 — What am I not giving my co-founders that they probably need?

Turn the lens on yourself. Where are you falling short for the team?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 7.3 — Is there an unspoken tension I am avoiding?

Name it. Even if you cannot resolve it here, naming it is the first step.

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

---

## Part 8: The 12-Month View

### 8.1 — Where do I see myself in 12 months?

Still in this role? A different role? A bigger version of this role? Outside the company?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 8.2 — What has to be true for me to still be here in 12 months?

Compensation, equity, role clarity, team dynamics, company progress — what are your minimum conditions?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

### 8.3 — What would cause me to leave?

Not a threat. A data point. What conditions — if they arose — would make you walk away?

_Your answer:_

&nbsp;

## After the Exercise

Once all founders have completed and shared their assessments:

1. **Identify overlapping concerns.** If multiple founders flag the same gap, it is real.
2. **Make specific commitments.** Each founder names one thing they will change in the next 30 days based on this exercise.
3. **Schedule a follow-up.** Revisit this exercise in 90 days. Did the commitments hold?
4. **Document decisions.** If any role changes, commitment adjustments, or support structures are agreed upon, document them in the Team Governance doc (Doc 10).
5. **Normalize the conversation.** This should not be a one-time event. The best founding teams do this regularly — quarterly at minimum.

## A Note on Ego

Every founder has ego invested in their role. That is natural — you are building something from nothing, and your identity is tied to the work. But ego becomes dangerous when it prevents you from seeing clearly.

The founders who build lasting companies are the ones who can separate "what I want to be true" from "what is actually true." This exercise asks you to practice that separation.

No one is asking you to quit. This exercise is asking you to think — honestly, rigorously, and without defensiveness — about whether you are in the right seat, doing the right work, at the right level.

If the answer is yes, you will know it more deeply after this exercise. If the answer is "not yet," you will know what to work on. And if the answer is no, you will have discovered it in a structured, respectful setting — not in a blowup at 2 AM.

That is the point.
