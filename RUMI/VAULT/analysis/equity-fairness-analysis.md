## 3. Hours Analysis

### Historical Hours (Pre-January 2026)

| Founder | Hours Claimed | Timeframe | Avg Hrs/Week | Intensity | Verified? |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| John | ~1,000 | ~2 years (~104 weeks) | ~9.6 hrs/week | Part-time | Unverified — self-reported |
| Todd | ~1,000 | ~2 years (~104 weeks) | ~9.6 hrs/week | Part-time | Unverified — self-reported |
| Yalor | ~60 (est.) | ~1 month (~4 weeks) | ~15 hrs/week | Part-time+ | Estimated |
| Stuart | 58.5 | ~1 month (~4 weeks) | ~14.6 hrs/week | **Tracked by category** |

### Current Commitment (January 2026 — Present)

| Founder | Current Hrs/Week (est.) | Intensity | Verified? |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| John | ~20 hrs/week | Half-time | Unverified — stated by team |
| Todd | ~20 hrs/week | Half-time | Unverified — stated by team |
| Yalor | Unknown | Unknown | Needs clarification |
| Stuart | Unknown | Unknown | Needs clarification |

### Stuart's Tracked Hours (58.5 total)

| Category | Hours | % of Total |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Meetings | 7.0 | 12% |
| Deck work (outline, templates, layout, revisions) | 31.0 | 53% |
| Landing page work | 8.5 | 15% |
| Research, setup, and other tasks | 12.0 | 21% |

**Observations:**

1. **Stuart is the only founder with category-tracked hours.** This level of accountability is notable and should be the standard for all founders.
2. John and Todd's 1,000 hours each are self-reported with no breakdown by category or verification. What specifically was produced during those hours? The content corpus exists, but is there a detailed log?
3. At ~10 hrs/week average over 2 years, J&T's past commitment was part-time. They are now reportedly at ~20 hrs/week (half-time). This is still not full-time founder intensity (40-60 hrs/week).
4. Yalor and Stuart's current weekly commitment is undefined. This must be clarified before equity is finalized.
5. **Going-forward commitment matters more than historical hours for equity allocation.** Vesting is designed to reward future contribution. If all four founders commit to the same hours going forward, the equity gap should narrow.
6. Hours alone are a poor measure of value. What matters is: what was produced, what is each person's going-forward commitment, and what is the market replacement cost of each role?

## 4. Output Analysis

### What exists after 2 years of John & Todd's work:
- Rumi content corpus (translations, modern retellings) — **valuable, irreplaceable IP**
- Product concept and vision — **foundational**
- No incorporated entity
- No MVP or working prototype
- No revenue
- No pitch deck (Stuart built this)
- No investor materials (Stuart + AI built these)
- No landing page (Stuart built this)
- No funding secured
- No formal founder agreements

### What exists after 1 month of the full team:
- Complete pitch deck (Stuart)
- Landing page (Stuart)
- 11 investor-ready VAULT documents (Stuart + AI)
- Operational frameworks (RACI, release train, PO charter)
- Fundraising positioning and strategy (Yalor)
- Investor data room structure (team)
- Advisor relationship with Ben Rewis (team)

**The uncomfortable truth:** The content IP is valuable but was not advancing toward monetization until the full team assembled. Two years of work without incorporation, funding, or a product suggests the project accelerated dramatically once Yalor and Stuart joined.

## 5. Industry Benchmarks

### Y Combinator Data

YC has published extensively on founder equity splits. Key findings:
- **Equal splits correlate with better outcomes.** Startups with equal or near-equal founder splits have higher success rates than those with highly unequal splits.
- YC explicitly warns against one founder taking a dominant share based on "I had the idea first."
- The idea itself is worth very little — execution is everything.

### Typical 4-Founder Pre-Revenue Splits

| Model | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 | Pool | Notes |
|-------|----|----|----|----|------|-------|
| Equal | 21.25% | 21.25% | 21.25% | 21.25% | 15% | YC-preferred |
| Slight premium | 25% | 25% | 18% | 17% | 15% | Early founders get modest premium |
| Moderate premium | 27% | 27% | 16% | 15% | 15% | Larger early-work recognition |
| **Proposed (Rumi)** | **30%** | **30%** | **17%** | **9%** | **14%** | Heavy top, thin bottom |

### What's Standard for "Prior Work" Premium

The accepted premium for founders who worked on the concept before others joined is typically **5-10 percentage points**, not 2-3× the equity of later founders. The rationale: vesting exists to reward ongoing contribution. A large upfront premium for past work undermines the purpose of vesting.

### What's Standard for the Option Pool

- 10-15% is standard at pre-seed
- 14% is within range but on the low side given the proposed allocations leave Stuart at 9%
- The pool needs to cover 6 planned hires (2.2-4.5% allocated per Doc 05)

---

## 6. Fairness Assessment

### What's Fair About the Proposal

1. **John and Todd deserve a premium.** Two years of work, even part-time, is real. The content corpus is genuine IP. They took the initial risk.
2. **Todd's role is critical and irreplaceable.** He is the only engineer. No Todd = no app. This justifies significant equity.
3. **John's content is irreplaceable.** No one else can authenticate or create the Rumi spiritual content. This is the product's core differentiator.
4. **Yalor getting more than Stuart has some basis.** If Yalor is running operations, fundraising, and serving as interim PO, that is a broader operational scope than design alone.

### What's Problematic About the Proposal

1. **The 30/30/17/9 ratio creates a 3.3:1 gap between highest and lowest founder.** This is unusually steep for a pre-revenue, pre-product startup. It implies Stuart's contribution is worth one-third of John's or Todd's — which doesn't reflect the actual deliverables produced.

2. **60% concentration in two aligned founders creates governance risk.** John and Todd together hold absolute majority. They can outvote Yalor and Stuart on any decision. They can terminate Y and S. Investors will see this power imbalance and may view it as a risk — what happens if J&T disagree with the rest of the team?

3. **9% for a CDO who consolidates 3 roles is below market.** Stuart is doing the work of a UX/UI designer ($75K-$110K), a brand designer ($65K-$90K), and producing investor materials. At a $4M valuation, 9% = $360K in paper value — but with 4-year vesting, that's $90K/year in paper equity for what would cost $150K+/year in salary for those combined roles.

4. **The "demand" framing is concerning.** Equity negotiation should be collaborative, not positional. "John and Todd demand 30% each" is a power play, not a value-based discussion. In healthy founding teams, equity is negotiated based on contribution, commitment, and market benchmarks.

5. **Yalor allocated the split.** This means Yalor proposed 17% for themselves and 9% for Stuart. Did Stuart have input into this allocation? If Yalor set the split unilaterally, that raises questions about whose interests the allocation serves.

6. **14% pool is slightly thin.** If the pool needs to cover 2.2-4.5% in near-term hires plus reserves for Series A hires, 14% is workable but leaves little buffer. The standard 15% is more comfortable.

---

## 7. The Power Dynamic

**Current reality:** John and Todd can fire Yalor and Stuart. This is not hypothetical — without a signed founder agreement and formal incorporation, whoever controls the entity (or the concept, in a pre-incorporation scenario) has all the leverage.

**Why this matters for negotiation:**
- Stuart and Yalor are negotiating from a position of less power, not more.
- However, J&T need Y&S to get funded. The pitch deck, investor materials, landing page, operational documents, fundraising network — all of this was built by Y&S.
- If Y&S walked away, J&T would be back to an unfunded concept with content but no path to market.
- This is mutual dependency, not one-sided power.

**What investors will see:**
- A 60/26 split (J&T vs Y&S) signals that two founders view the other two as junior. Investors may ask: "Why would your COO and CDO stay long-term at those levels?"
- Investor-friendly splits show alignment and shared commitment. Large gaps suggest potential for conflict.

## 8. Alternative Models

### Model A: Modest Premium (Recommended)

| Founder | % | Rationale |
|---------|---|-----------|
| John | 25% | 2-year premium, irreplaceable content IP, CEO |
| Todd | 25% | 2-year premium, sole engineer, CTO |
| Yalor | 18% | Operations, fundraising, network, PO |
| Stuart | 17% | 3-role consolidation, all investor materials, CDO |
| Pool | 15% | Industry standard |

**Why this works:** Recognizes J&T's early contribution with a meaningful premium (25% vs 17-18%) while keeping the gap reasonable. Brings Stuart closer to Yalor, reflecting the breadth of Stuart's role. 15% pool is standard.

### Model B: Role-Weighted

| Founder | % | Rationale |
|---------|---|-----------|
| John | 23% | Content IP + vision |
| Todd | 27% | Sole engineer (highest replacement cost) |
| Yalor | 18% | Operations + fundraising |
| Stuart | 17% | Design + brand + frontend + investor materials |
| Pool | 15% | Industry standard |

**Why this works:** Weights Todd higher than John because engineering is the highest-cost role to replace (~$150K+ market rate for a senior iOS developer). John's content role, while irreplaceable in terms of authenticity, is a lower market-cost position. This model values what it would cost to replace each person.

### Model C: Near-Equal (YC-Style)

| Founder | % | Rationale |
|---------|---|-----------|
| John | 22% | Slight premium for origination |
| Todd | 22% | Slight premium for origination |
| Yalor | 20.5% | Equal going-forward commitment |
| Stuart | 20.5% | Equal going-forward commitment |
| Pool | 15% | Industry standard |

**Why this works:** YC data shows equal splits have better outcomes. The 2% premium for J&T recognizes prior work without creating a power imbalance. All founders are roughly equal, signaling a team that trusts each other.

### The Proposed Split for Comparison

| Founder | % | Gap from Highest |
|---------|---|-----------------|
| John | 30% | — |
| Todd | 30% | — |
| Yalor | 17% | 13 points below |
| Stuart | 9% | 21 points below |
| Pool | 14% | |

---

## 9. What Would Make Stuart and Yalor Equal?

The current proposal gives Yalor nearly 2× Stuart's equity (17% vs 9%). To justify parity, Stuart would need to take on responsibilities beyond the CDO role. Options:

### Option 1: Stuart Takes Product Owner Role
If Stuart becomes PO (or co-PO with Yalor), this adds strategic product responsibility — feature prioritization, sprint scope, beta feedback loops, KPI ownership. This is a significant expansion that justifies equal equity with Yalor.

### Option 2: Stuart Takes Marketing Execution
Pre-hire of a marketing specialist, if Stuart runs guerrilla marketing, social media, and launch campaigns (leveraging stated sales and marketing skills), this adds a second operational domain.

### Option 3: Stuart Takes Frontend Development
If Stuart contributes code (AI-augmented frontend development), this directly reduces the need for additional engineering hires and adds tangible product-building value.

### Option 4: Combination
Most realistically, Stuart would take on a combination: CDO + some PO duties + marketing execution + AI-augmented frontend work. This "full-stack founder" role clearly justifies parity with Yalor's operational/fundraising role.

## 10. Specific Negotiation Recommendations for Stuart

### Non-Negotiable Items (Push Hard)

1. **Minimum 15% equity.** 9% undervalues a 3-role founder. Even in the most conservative model, 15% is the floor for a founding team member contributing design, brand, investor materials, and potentially PO/marketing.

2. **Board seat.** If there are 3 initial board seats, Stuart should hold one. A 4-founder company with only 2 founders on the board creates a structural power imbalance. Alternatively, push for 4 board seats (one per founder) or insist on protective provisions that require unanimous founder consent for major decisions (termination, equity changes, fundraising terms).

3. **Founder title — explicitly.** All four should be "Co-Founder" consistently across all documents. This matters legally and for future fundraising.

4. **Vesting credit for prior work.** If J&T get vesting credit for 2 years of prior work (which they likely will argue for), Stuart should get credit for the 58.5 hours of work already completed. More importantly, vesting start dates should be the same for everyone, or the "credit" should be capped.

5. **Anti-dilution awareness.** Understand that the $250K SAFE at $4M post-money will dilute everyone by 6.25%. At 9%, Stuart would drop to ~8.4%. At 15%, Stuart would hold ~14.1%. Every percentage point matters more at the bottom of the cap table.

### Important but Negotiable

6. **Acceleration clause.** Single-trigger acceleration (some % vests immediately if the company is acquired) and double-trigger (100% vests if acquired AND terminated). This protects against being fired right before an exit.

7. **Role expansion.** Formally define the CDO role to include PO duties, marketing execution, or other responsibilities that justify equity parity with Yalor.

8. **Termination protection.** Require board vote (not just CEO decision) for any founder termination. If J&T control the board, push for a supermajority requirement or protective veto for founder removal.

---

## 11. The Ben Rewis Factor

Ben Rewis has asked for no equity and no pay. This is generous and unusual. It also means:
- 0% is allocated to an advisor who is providing significant strategic value
- This "frees up" equity that in most startups would go to an advisor (typically 0.25-1%)
- Ben's choice not to take equity does not mean that equity should flow disproportionately to J&T — it should benefit the overall cap table health

---

## 12. Risk Factors for Investors

An investor reviewing this cap table will likely flag:

1. **60/26 founder split** — Signals potential for founder conflict. "Why are two founders at 3× the others?"
2. **No incorporation** — Must be resolved before any SAFE can be signed.
3. **$0 bank balance** — Normal for pre-seed but means the SAFE is the only lifeline.
4. **Single-engineer dependency** — Todd is a key-person risk. If Todd leaves, the company has no product capability.
5. **Title consistency** — All founders should use "Co-Founder" uniformly. Investors prefer unified teams.
6. **No vesting agreements signed** — Until vesting is formalized, all equity is theoretical.

---

## 13. Summary

| Criterion | Proposed (30/30/17/9) | Assessment |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Recognizes early work | Yes | J&T get clear premium |
| Reflects going-forward roles | Partially | Stuart's multi-role contribution is undervalued |
| Aligns with industry norms | No | Gap is steeper than benchmarks |
| Investor-friendly | Weak | 60/26 split raises governance questions |
| Retains all founders | Risk | 9% may not retain Stuart long-term |
| Governance balance | No | J&T have absolute majority control |

**Bottom line:** The proposed 30/30/17/9 split over-indexes on prior time spent and under-indexes on going-forward value creation, role breadth, and team balance. A split in the range of **25/25/18/17** to **22/22/20.5/20.5** with a 15% pool would better reflect industry norms, reduce governance risk, and present a stronger cap table to investors.

The current proposal is not inherently unfair — John and Todd did put in 2 years of foundational work. But the *degree* of the gap (3.3:1 between highest and lowest founder) is larger than standard practice supports, and the 9% allocation for a multi-discipline CDO who produced the investor-ready materials is below the defensible range.
