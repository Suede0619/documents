# What Seed Investors Need to See

Rumi App — Pre-Seed / Seed Investor Readiness Checklist  
Prepared: January 26, 2026  
Status: Internal Working Document

---

## Overview

Pre-seed/seed investors are betting on **team + market + vision**. They're not expecting revenue or a finished product. They need to believe three things:

1. **This team can build it.**
2. **This market is real and big enough.**
3. **This specific approach has an unfair advantage.**

This document covers exactly what they'll evaluate, what Rumi has, and what's missing.

---

## The Decision Framework

Here's the uncomfortable truth about pre-seed investing. Checklists and data rooms are what investors review, but the decision is usually made on **gut + three questions:**

1. **Do I believe in this founder/team?** The #1 factor. Do they seem capable, committed, and honest? Do they have domain expertise? Will they survive the hard times?

2. **Is this market real?** $6B wellness app market, 40M meditation app users in the US, growing 15-20% YoY. The question is whether the Rumi/spiritual niche is large enough or too narrow.

3. **Why will this win?** The answer for Rumi: John's 40+ years of authentic Sufi lineage is a moat no competitor can replicate. Calm can hire a meditation teacher. They can't hire a Sheikh with decades of Masnavi scholarship. This is the "unfair advantage."

## Tier 1: Must-Have (No Meeting Without These)

These are table stakes. Without these, investors won't take the meeting or will end it early.

| Item | Status | Owner | Notes |
|------|:------:|-------|-------|
| Pitch deck (10-15 slides) | Draft complete | Stuart | Needs wireframes/mockups added |
| Clear ask — $250K SAFE, $4M post-money cap | Defined | Yalor | Standard YC Post-Money SAFE recommended |
| Credible founding team — complementary skills, why these people | Partially ready | All | Need signed founder agreement |
| Market size — TAM/SAM/SOM for spiritual wellness apps | In deck + competitor analysis | Stuart + Yalor | $6B wellness, spiritual niche underserved |
| Problem statement — "spiritual famine," underserved seekers | In deck + landing page copy | John + Stuart | Strong narrative already in place |
| Product vision — what is the Rumi App, who is it for, why now | In deck | John | John's lineage is the story |

---

## Tier 2: Must-Have for Due Diligence (Before They Write a Check)

After the pitch meeting goes well, investors will ask to see these. The data room must be ready.

| Item | Status | Owner | Blocking? |
|------|:------:|-------|:---------:|
| **Incorporation (Delaware C-Corp)** | Not done | Yalor + legal | **Yes — cannot sign SAFE without entity** |
| **Cap table** | Draft in Doc 09, needs equity split finalized | All | **Yes — investors must see the split** |
| **Founder agreements** | Not done | All | **Yes — no agreements = red flag** |
| **SAFE document** | Template needed (YC standard) | Yalor | Yes |
| **Use of funds** — how the $250K gets spent | In Doc 01 (cash flow forecast) | Yalor | Yes |
| **Financial projections** — 12-18 month cash flow | In Doc 01, Doc 02 | Yalor + Stuart | Drafted |
| **Wireframes / mockups** — 5-8 screens showing the product | **Not done** | **Stuart** | **Yes — the deck has a visual hole without this** |
| **IP documentation** — who owns the Rumi corpus? IP assignment | Not done | John + legal | Yes — if the corpus is John's personal IP, investors will flag this |
| **83(b) elections** | Cannot file until shares are granted | All founders | Must file within 30 days of stock grant |

## Tier 3: Differentiators (What Gets You a "Yes" Over Other Startups)

These aren't required, but each one significantly increases the close rate.

| Item | Impact | Status | Owner |
|------|--------|:------:|-------|
| **Working prototype** | High — changes conversation from "imagine this" to "try this" | Todd is building (half-time) | Todd |
| **User signal** — 5-10 conversations showing demand | High — "we've validated demand with real seekers" | Not done | Stuart + Yalor |
| **Landing page with email signups** | Medium — shows traction and interest | Built | Stuart |
| **Content sample** — one guided journey experience | High — let the investor *feel* the product | Not done | John |
| **Advisor credibility** — Ben Rewis | Medium — demonstrates external validation | Ben is onboard (no equity) | Team |
| **Category design narrative** — "Spiritual Companion App" as a new category | Medium-High — Play Bigger strategy is compelling | In documents | Stuart + Yalor |
| **Competitive moat answer** — "Why can't Calm just add a Rumi section?" | High — investors will ask this | John's lineage + corpus is the answer | John |
| **Email signup count** — even 100-200 pre-seed is signal | Medium | Landing page live, count unknown | Stuart |

---

## Tier 4: Nice-to-Have (Impressive but Not Expected Pre-Seed)

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Beta metrics (DAU, retention) | Only relevant if you have a working beta before investor meetings |
| Revenue | Not expected pre-product |
| Partnership LOIs | If you have wellness center or retreat partnerships in pipeline |
| Press coverage | A mention in Lion's Roar, Tricycle, Well+Good, or Psychology Today |
| App Store listing draft | Shows you've thought about launch positioning |
| Customer testimonials | From beta users — post-beta only |

## What's Missing Right Now (Ranked by Urgency)

| # | Item | Why It's Blocking | Owner | Est. Effort |
|---|------|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Incorporation** | Cannot sign a SAFE without a legal entity | Yalor + legal | 1-2 weeks (Clerky recommended) |
| 2 | **Founder agreement + equity split** | Investors will ask, and "we haven't decided" is a red flag | All | Team discussion + attorney |
| 3 | **Wireframes / mockups in pitch deck** | Investors need to *see* the product, not just hear about it | Stuart | 15-22 hours |
| 4 | **User signal** (5-10 conversations) | "We've validated demand" vs. "we think people want this" | Stuart + Yalor | 5-8 hours |
| 5 | **Use of funds slide** (specific) | Where exactly does $250K go, month by month? | Yalor | 2-3 hours |
| 6 | **IP assignment** | Who owns the Rumi corpus? If it's John personally, that's a risk | John + legal | Attorney needed |
| 7 | **Working prototype** | Not required but dramatically increases close rate | Todd | Depends on Todd's timeline |

## Common Questions Investors Will Ask

Prepare answers for each of these. They come up in nearly every pre-seed meeting.

### About the Team
- "Why are you the right team to build this?"
- "What's the equity split?" (They will ask. Have an answer.)
- "Are all founders full-time?" (Honest answer: not yet. "We will be once funded" is acceptable.)
- "What happens if your CTO leaves?"

### About the Market
- "How big is the spiritual wellness app market?"
- "Who are your competitors and why are you different?"
- "Is Rumi too niche? What's your SAM?"
- "Do people actually pay for spiritual apps?"

### About the Product
- "Can I see the app?" (This is where wireframes/prototype matter)
- "What's your core user flow?"
- "How is this different from the Rumi poems I can find on Google for free?"
- "What's the retention strategy? Meditation apps have high churn."

### About the Business
- "What's your monetization model?"
- "What's your path to $1M ARR?"
- "How will you acquire users?"
- "What do you do with $250K? How long does it last?"

### The Hard Question
- **"Why can't Calm or Headspace just add a Rumi section?"**
  - Answer: Authenticity cannot be replicated. John Wyrick (Sheikh Firdousi) has 40+ years as a Sufi teacher with direct lineage. The Rumi corpus — Masnavi translations and modern retellings — is original work, not public domain rehash. Calm could hire a narrator to read Rumi translations. They cannot create an authentic spiritual companion experience rooted in decades of lived practice. The content IP is the moat.
