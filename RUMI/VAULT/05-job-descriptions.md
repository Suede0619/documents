## Planned Hires (Post $250K Funding)

### UI/UX Designer (Dedicated)

**Type:** Full-Time Employee (or contractor with equity)  
**Reports To:** Stuart Paul (CDO)  
**Dotted Line:** Yalor Mewn (product priorities)  
**Target Hire Date:** Q3 2026 (with funding)  
**Location:** Remote  

#### Why This Role
Stuart is currently handling brand strategy, UI/UX design, pitch deck, and marketing assets simultaneously. A dedicated UI/UX designer frees Stuart to focus on strategic design leadership while the new hire executes day-to-day screen design, prototyping, and user testing.

#### Key Responsibilities
- Day-to-day UI/UX design: screens, components, interactions
- Prototyping in Figma (interactive prototypes for user testing)
- User testing coordination and analysis (work with YM on beta feedback)
- Design system maintenance and component library updates
- Design-to-development handoff (specs, assets, annotations)
- Marketing asset support (social media templates, App Store screenshots)
- Collaboration with Todd on implementation feasibility

#### Required Skills/Experience
- 3+ years mobile app design (iOS focus, SwiftUI awareness a plus)
- Figma proficiency (components, auto-layout, prototyping, design tokens)
- Understanding of contemplative/wellness app UX patterns
- User research experience (usability testing, heuristic evaluation)

#### Compensation

| Component | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Salary** | $30,000 - $45,000/year | Below-market, startup-stage adjustment |
| **Equity** | 0.50% - 1.00% | From employee option pool (15%) |
| **Vesting** | 4 years / 1 year cliff | Standard |

**Market rate reference:** A mid-level UI/UX designer commands $75K-$110K at market rate (remote, non-FAANG). The startup discount of 50-60% is offset by meaningful equity — at a $4M valuation, 0.75% = $30,000 in paper value, growing with the company.
