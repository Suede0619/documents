## BLOCKING (Must Complete Before Investor Meetings)

### 1. Recruit First 500-5,000 TestFlight Users — NEW #1 PRIORITY
- **What:** Build and execute a recruitment plan to get up to 5,000 people onto TestFlight once the MVP ships
- **Why blocking:** Per advisor (Former Head of Product at Twitter): "Drop the simplest version of the app into TestFlight. Invite up to 5,000 people and start tracking what they do." Traction data from real users is the strongest asset for investor meetings. Without users, the TestFlight MVP generates no data.
- **Recruitment sources:**
  - Friends and family (all 4 founders' networks)
  - John's spiritual community and teaching network
  - Landing page / waitlist signups
  - Rumi book communities (Goodreads, Reddit r/Rumi, r/Sufism)
  - Meditation and spiritual practice groups
  - Social media outreach (Instagram, Twitter/X)
- **Target:** 500 users in first week, scaling to 5,000 over 4-6 weeks
- **Deliverable:** Recruitment plan document + execution (emails, posts, outreach)
- **Reference:** PRD Phase 0, VAULT/06-release-train-schedule.md (Phase 0)

### 2. Define Validation Success Metrics
- **What:** Define the specific thresholds that constitute "validation" before committing to full build and fundraising
- **Why blocking:** Without clear metrics, the team cannot objectively decide if the TestFlight data supports proceeding
- **Proposed thresholds (team must confirm):**
  - D1 retention > 30%
  - D7 retention > 15%
  - Paywall tap-through > 5%
  - Session length > 3 minutes
  - 10+ organic user language quotes collected
- **Deliverable:** Agreed validation criteria documented in PRD
- **Reference:** PRD Phase 0, VAULT/02-weighted-sales-forecast.md (Pre-Launch Validation Data)

### 3. Incorporation
- **What:** File Delaware C-Corp incorporation (Clerky recommended)
- **Why blocking:** Cannot sign SAFE, issue stock, open bank account, or file 83(b) without a legal entity. This is the #1 blocker for everything.
- **Deliverable:**
  - Certificate of Incorporation (PDF)
  - EIN from IRS
  - Business bank account opened

- **Why blocking:** Cap table must be resolved before any legal documents
- **Deliverable:** Agreed equity split, documented
- **Reference:** VAULT/09-cap-table.md, VAULT/analysis/equity-fairness-analysis.md

### 5. Founder Agreement — Coordinate Drafting
- **What:** Engage startup attorney to draft formal founder agreement based on VAULT/10-team-governance.md
- **Why blocking:** No legal protection for any founder without this
- **Deliverable:** Signed founder agreement (all 4 founders)
- **Reference:** VAULT/10-team-governance.md, VAULT/08-investor-data-room-checklist.md (Section 3: Founder Agreements)

### 6. SAFE Template
- **What:** Download YC Post-Money SAFE template, customize terms, get legal review
- **Why blocking:** This is the actual investment instrument
- **Deliverable:** Reviewed SAFE template ready for investor signature
- **Reference:** VAULT/08-investor-data-room-checklist.md (Section 3: SAFE Document)

### 7. IP Assignment — Coordinate
- **What:** Ensure all founders sign IP assignment agreements after incorporation
