## BLOCKING (Must Complete Before Investor Meetings)

### 1. Run Micro-Ad Audience Discovery Tests — NEW #1 PRIORITY
- **What:** Run $50-100 in ads across Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook to discover the actual audience
- **Why blocking:** Per advisor (Former Head of Product at Twitter): "Put $50-100 into Pinterest Ads, Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads. Define your audience from those ads." This data tells us who actually responds to the Rumi App concept — demographics, platform, creative that works — before committing the $100K marketing budget.
- **Budget:** $50-100 total (founder-funded, pre-SAFE)
- **What to do:**
  - Create 2-3 ad creatives (verse image, journey preview, brand message)
  - Run on Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook simultaneously
  - Track: CPM, click-through rate, audience demographics of engagers
  - Let ads run for 1-2 weeks, then analyze
- **Deliverable:** Audience discovery report: which platform, which demographic, which creative — ready for investor data room
