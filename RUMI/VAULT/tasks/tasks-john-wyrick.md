## BLOCKING (Must Complete Before Investor Meetings)

### 1. Provide Minimum Content for TestFlight MVP — NEW #1 PRIORITY
- **What:** Deliver the minimum content needed for the TestFlight MVP validation build
- **Why blocking:** Per advisor (Former Head of Product at Twitter): "Don't build anything substantial till you can validate the market." Todd cannot ship the TestFlight MVP without content from John. This is the #1 team priority — every day of delay is a day without validation data.
- **Content needed:**
  - **30 daily verses** (Farsi original + English translation + modern retelling) — enough for one month of daily content
  - **One complete guided journey** (5 steps: verse, interpretation, reflection, breath, integration) — a single journey the team can test and measure
- **What is NOT needed yet:** Full 25,000-verse Masnavi library, multiple journeys, Shams content, themed collections. These come after validation proves the core experience works.
- **Target:** Deliver to Todd within 1 week of this task being assigned
- **Deliverable:** Content files ready for app integration (text format, organized by day/step)
- **Reference:** PRD Phase 0, VAULT/06-release-train-schedule.md (Phase 0)

### 2. Recruit TestFlight Users from Spiritual Community
- **What:** Leverage your 40+ years of spiritual teaching network to recruit TestFlight users
- **Why blocking:** The team needs up to 5,000 TestFlight users. John's community is the highest-quality recruitment source — these are people who already care about Rumi.
- **Actions:**
  - Identify spiritual community contacts, students, and teaching network members
  - Send personal invitations to join TestFlight
  - Ask community members to invite others
- **Target:** Recruit 200-500 users from personal network
- **Deliverable:** Outreach completed, contacts invited
- **Reference:** PRD Phase 0

### 3. Founder Equity Discussion
- **What:** Participate in equity split negotiation with all founders
- **Why blocking:** Investors will ask about the cap table. "We haven't decided" is a red flag.
- **Deliverable:** Agreement on equity percentages
- **Reference:** VAULT/09-cap-table.md, VAULT/analysis/equity-fairness-analysis.md

### 4. IP Assignment — Rumi Content Corpus
- **What:** Inventory all Rumi content created to date AND sign IP assignment transferring it to the company
- **Why blocking:** If the content IP belongs to John personally (not the company), investors will flag this as a critical risk. This is the company's primary asset.
- **Deliverable:** 
  - Written inventory: number of Masnavi translations, modern retellings, guided journey scripts
  - Signed IP assignment agreement (after incorporation)
- **Reference:** VAULT/08-investor-data-room-checklist.md (Section 5: IP Assignment Agreements)

### 5. Prior IP Disclosure
- **What:** Disclose any prior intellectual property you want to EXCLUDE from the company assignment
- **Why blocking:** Required in the founder agreement
- **Deliverable:** Written list of excluded prior IP (or "none")
- **Reference:** VAULT/10-team-governance.md
