## Shared Values & Commitments

### Our Mission
To bring Rumi's wisdom into the hands of millions — daily, authentically, beautifully — as guidance, not content; as sanctuary, not feed.

### Our Commitments as Founders

1. **Hold the Vision** — Carry the company through uncertainty when there is no validation
2. **Make Decisions with Incomplete Information** — Act decisively, learn quickly
3. **Absorb Risk** — Financial, reputational, and emotional — before outcomes are clear
4. **Show Up Consistently** — Even when momentum is slow or invisible
5. **Take Accountability** — Own failures, share credit for successes
6. **Maintain Spiritual Integrity** — Never compromise Rumi's teachings for metrics
7. **Communicate Transparently** — Surface problems early, share context openly
8. **Respect Domain Authority** — Trust each founder's expertise within their domain

## Decision-Making Framework

### Decision Categories

| Category | Who Decides | Process |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Vision & Mission | John (CEO) | Consult team, final authority |
| Spiritual/Content Integrity | John (CEO) | Veto power on authenticity |
| Technical Architecture | Todd (CTO) | Consult team, final authority |
| Business Operations | Yalor (COO) | Consult team, final authority |
| Brand, Design & Marketing | Stuart (CDO / Marketing Lead) | Consult team, final authority |
| Equity & Ownership | Full Team | Unanimous consent required |
| Major Pivots | Full Team | Unanimous consent required |
| Hiring/Firing | Relevant Lead + CEO | Consultation with team |
| Fundraising Terms | CEO + COO | Board approval if applicable |
| Spending > $2,500 | CEO or COO approval | Either can approve; both notified |
| Spending > $10,000 | Full team vote | Majority required |
| Spending > $25,000 | Full team vote | Unanimous required |

**Recommendation on spending thresholds:** The amounts above are starting points. Adjust based on your comfort level. The key principle is that small operational expenses don't require group approval (that slows everything down), but significant expenditures need consensus.

### Voting Rights

| Decision Type | Voting Requirement |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Day-to-day operations | Domain owner decides |
| Significant business decisions | Majority vote (3 of 4) |
| Major strategic decisions | Supermajority (3 of 4) |
| Equity changes, exits, pivots | Unanimous (4 of 4) |

### Deadlock Resolution
If a vote results in a 2-2 tie on a significant business decision:
1. Table the decision for 48 hours of reflection
2. Each side presents their case in writing
3. If still deadlocked, CEO breaks the tie
4. Exception: CEO-involved deadlocks go to advisor mediation (Ben Rewis)

## Meeting Cadence

| Meeting | Frequency | Attendees | Purpose | Duration |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Async Standup | Daily (Slack/ClickUp) | All | Status updates, blockers | 5 min async |
| Sprint Planning | Weekly (Tuesday) | All | Product priorities, scope | 1 hour |
| Founder Sync | Bi-weekly | Founders only | Strategic decisions, governance | 1 hour |
| Advisor Session | Monthly | All + Ben Rewis | Strategic guidance, accountability | 2 hours |
| Board Meeting | Quarterly | Board members | Governance, financials, strategy | 1-2 hours |
| All-Hands Review | Monthly | All + any contractors | Progress, culture, alignment | 30 min |

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Step 1: Direct Conversation (within 48 hours)
- Founders address disagreements directly, 1-on-1
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Assume positive intent
- Document the outcome

### Step 2: Mediated Discussion (within 1 week)
- If unresolved, bring to full founder group
- Each party states position, others listen without interruption
- Seek consensus solution
- CEO facilitates (unless CEO is party to conflict)

### Step 3: Advisor Mediation (within 2 weeks)
- If consensus cannot be reached, engage Ben Rewis as mediator
- For CEO-involved conflicts, advisor mediates directly
- Advisor recommendation is advisory, not binding

### Step 4: External Mediation (within 30 days)
- For unresolved conflicts after Step 3
- Engage professional mediator (agreed upon by both parties)
- Both parties agree in advance: mediation result is binding
- Cost split equally between parties (or covered by company)

### Step 5: Buyout/Exit
- If irreconcilable differences persist after mediation
- Follow exit provisions below
- 90-day transition period

## Commitment Expectations

### Time Commitment

| Founder | Expected Commitment | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| John Wyrick | **[DECISION NEEDED: Full-time / Part-time / X hrs/week]** | Content creation, vision, stakeholder relations |
| Todd Bowden | **[DECISION NEEDED: Full-time / Part-time / X hrs/week]** | Core product development |
| Yalor Mewn | **[DECISION NEEDED: Full-time / Part-time / X hrs/week]** | Operations, fundraising |
| Stuart Paul | **[DECISION NEEDED: Full-time / Part-time / X hrs/week]** | Design, brand, pitch materials |

**Recommendation:** At pre-seed, it's common for founders to have varying commitments. Be honest about actual hours. Equity should reflect both contribution and commitment level. Full-time founders typically receive more equity than part-time founders.

### Outside Activities

All founders agree to:
- **Permitted:** Outside activities that do not compete with the Rumi App or spiritual companion app category
- **Disclosure required:** Any engagement exceeding 10 hours/week, any advisory roles, any equity positions in related companies
- **Prohibited:** Working on or investing in competing spiritual/meditation/poetry apps during the vesting period
- **Review:** Disclose current outside activities within 30 days of signing this agreement

### Current Disclosures

| Founder | Outside Activities | Competing? |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| John Wyrick | **[DISCLOSURE NEEDED]** | No |
| Todd Bowden | **[DISCLOSURE NEEDED]** | No |
| Yalor Mewn | **[DISCLOSURE NEEDED]** | No |
| Stuart Paul | **[DISCLOSURE NEEDED]** | No |

## Compensation

### Current (Pre-Funding)
- No cash compensation until funding is secured
- Founders are financing the company with labor — this is the basis for founding equity
- Reasonable, pre-approved business expenses may be tracked for reimbursement post-funding

### Post-Funding Compensation

**DECISION NEEDED:** Define salary structure after $250K SAFE closes.

**Recommendation for $250K raise:**

| Role | Recommended Range | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| CEO (John) | $0 - $3,000/month | Defer salary to extend runway; founders typically take below-market |
| CTO (Todd) | $3,000 - $5,000/month | Highest technical demand, may need living wage |
| COO (Yalor) | $2,000 - $4,000/month | Ops critical for fundraising |
| CDO (Stuart) | $2,000 - $4,000/month | Design critical for product + deck |

**Key principle:** At $250K raise, founder salaries should be minimal. The $50K "Team" allocation covers both new hires AND any founder stipends. Keep founder cash compensation at or below $3-5K/month to maximize runway. Full market-rate salaries come at Series A.

### Expense Reimbursement Policy

| Category | Pre-Approval Required? | Limit |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Software/tools (for company use) | No, if < $100/month | $100/month per founder |
| Travel (company business) | Yes, from COO | Actual cost, economy class |
| Meals (business meetings) | No | $50/meal, receipts required |
| Hardware (for development) | Yes, from CEO or COO | Case-by-case |
| Professional development | Yes, from CEO | $500/year per founder |

## Equity Terms

### Vesting
- All founders: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Vesting starts: **[DATE — see Cap Table Doc 09]**
- See Cap Table document (09) for specific allocations and share counts

### Acceleration

**DECISION NEEDED:** Choose acceleration terms.

**Recommended (industry standard):**

| Trigger | Effect | When It Applies |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Single Trigger** (Change of Control only) | 25% of unvested shares accelerate | Company is acquired |
| **Double Trigger** (CoC + involuntary termination within 12 months) | 100% of unvested shares accelerate | Founder is terminated or constructively dismissed within 12 months of acquisition |

**Why double trigger is preferred:** Investors prefer double trigger because it keeps founders incentivized to stay through an acquisition transition. Single trigger at 100% means founders could walk away immediately after a sale. The 25% single trigger provides a small cushion; the 100% double trigger provides full protection if the acquirer pushes founders out.

## Exit Provisions

### Voluntary Departure

| Scenario | Vested Equity | Unvested Equity | Notice Period |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Before cliff (< 1 year) | 0% — all forfeited | All forfeited | 30 days |
| After cliff, Good Leaver | Keep all vested shares | Forfeited — returns to pool | 60 days |
| After cliff, Bad Leaver | Company may repurchase vested at lower of FMV or original cost | All forfeited | Immediate |

**"For Cause" includes:** Fraud, embezzlement, willful misconduct, material breach of founder agreement, felony conviction, willful failure to perform duties after written notice and 30-day cure period.

### Buyout Rights

- **Right of First Refusal (ROFR):** Company has first right to purchase any shares a founder wishes to sell or transfer, at the same price offered by the third party
- **Buyout price:** Fair Market Value as determined by the most recent 409A valuation, or mutual agreement, or independent appraisal if disputed

## Intellectual Property

### Assignment
- All founders irrevocably assign to the company all IP created in connection with company work
- This includes: code, designs, content, translations, retellings, brand assets, marketing materials, business processes
- **Prior IP:** Any IP created before the company formation remains with the creator, but is licensed to the company on a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide basis if used in the product
- Assignment is effective upon signing; formal IP assignment agreements to be executed separately

### Prior IP Inventory

**Each founder must list any prior IP they are contributing:**

| Founder | Prior IP Contributed | License Terms |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| John Wyrick | Masnavi translations, retellings, guided journey content, spiritual teachings | **[ASSIGNMENT OR LICENSE — DECISION NEEDED]** |
| Todd Bowden | Any pre-existing code libraries or frameworks | Perpetual royalty-free license to company |
| Yalor Mewn | Business frameworks, operational processes | Perpetual royalty-free license to company |
| Stuart Paul | Design templates, illustration assets | Perpetual royalty-free license to company |

**Critical note on John's content:** The Masnavi translations and modern retellings are the company's core asset. It is strongly recommended that this IP be **assigned** (not merely licensed) to the company. Without assignment, the company does not own its primary product, which is a dealbreaker for investors. Discuss with legal counsel.

### Confidentiality
- Founders maintain confidentiality of all non-public company information during and after engagement
- **Duration:** 3 years after departure (standard for startups; trade secrets protected indefinitely under law)
- Includes: financial data, user data, product roadmap, investor conversations, proprietary content, technical architecture
- Permitted disclosures: as required by law, to personal legal/tax advisors under their own confidentiality obligations

### Non-Compete

**DECISION NEEDED:** Non-compete terms. Recommended:

| Term | Recommendation | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Duration | 12 months post-departure | Longer is harder to enforce; 12 months is standard |
| Scope | Spiritual companion apps, meditation apps with poetry/classical text focus | Narrow scope is more enforceable |
| Geography | Worldwide (digital product) | Standard for app companies |
| Enforceability note | California does not enforce non-competes; if founders are CA-based, rely on non-solicit and confidentiality instead | Check state law for each founder |

### Non-Solicit

| Term | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|
| **Employees/contractors** | Cannot solicit company employees or contractors for 18 months post-departure |
| **Customers/users** | Cannot solicit company users or business partners for 12 months post-departure |
| **Investors** | Cannot solicit company investors for a competing venture for 24 months post-departure |

---

## Board of Directors

### Current Board Composition

**DECISION NEEDED:** Define initial board.

**Recommendation for pre-seed (4 founder seats):**

A 4-founder company should have 4 board seats at pre-seed. Excluding any co-founder from the board creates a structural power imbalance that investors will flag.

| Seat | Holder | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| Seat 1 | John Wyrick (CEO) | Founder seat |
| Seat 2 | Todd Bowden (CTO) | Founder seat |
| Seat 3 | Yalor Mewn (COO) | Founder seat |
| Seat 4 | Stuart Paul (CDO / Marketing Lead) | Founder seat |

**At Series A (projected):** Expand to 5 seats:

| Seat | Holder | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| Seat 1 | John Wyrick | Founder seat |
| Seat 2 | Yalor Mewn | Founder seat |
| Seat 3 | Stuart Paul | Founder seat |
| Seat 4 | Lead investor representative | Investor seat |
| Seat 5 | Todd Bowden or independent director (mutually agreed) | Founder/Independent seat |

**Board observer:** Ben Rewis may attend board meetings as a non-voting observer (standard for advisors).

**Note:** A 4-seat board can deadlock 2-2. Deadlock resolution: table for 48 hours, written cases, then CEO breaks the tie (per Decision-Making Framework above). At Series A, the 5th seat resolves the even-number issue.

## Notes

- This document is a governance framework, not a legal contract. Formal legal agreements (stock purchase agreements, IP assignment agreements, founder agreements) must be drafted by qualified counsel.
- All founders should have this document reviewed by their personal attorneys before signing.
- Annual review recommended.
- Update when circumstances change materially.
- **Estimated legal cost for formalizing:** $3,000-$8,000 for a startup attorney to convert this into binding agreements (or use Clerky for templated versions at ~$800-$2,500).
