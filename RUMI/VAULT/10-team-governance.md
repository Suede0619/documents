To bring Rumi's wisdom into the hands of millions—daily, authentically, beautifully—as guidance, not content; as sanctuary, not feed.

### Our Commitments as Founders

1. **Hold the Vision** - Carry the company through uncertainty when there is no validation
2. **Make Decisions with Incomplete Information** - Act decisively, learn quickly
3. **Absorb Risk** - Financial, reputational, and emotional—before outcomes are clear
4. **Show Up Consistently** - Even when momentum is slow or invisible
5. **Take Accountability** - Own failures, share credit for successes
6. **Maintain Spiritual Integrity** - Never compromise Rumi's teachings for metrics
