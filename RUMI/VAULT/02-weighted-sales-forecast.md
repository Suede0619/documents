# Weighted Sales Forecast

Rumi App - Pre-Seed Revenue Projections  
Last Updated: January 26, 2026

---

## Overview

Revenue projections weighted by probability of occurrence. More realistic than simple projections — shows investors you understand risk and aren't just selling optimism.

---

## Pricing Model

| Tier | Price | Annual Equivalent |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Monthly | $9.99/month | $119.88/year |
| Annual | $96/year (20% discount) | $96/year |
| **Blended Average** | **~$100/year (~$8.33/month)** | Assumes 60% annual / 40% monthly mix |

**Subscription mix rationale:** Industry data shows meditation/spiritual apps typically see 55-65% annual subscriptions when annual pricing offers a meaningful discount (20%+). Annual subscribers have significantly lower churn and higher LTV.

## Pre-Launch Validation Data (Feb-Apr 2026)

Before the revenue projections below take effect, the validation phase generates real data that either confirms or adjusts these assumptions.

### TestFlight MVP Metrics (Target: Feb-Mar 2026)

| Metric | What It Validates | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| DAU / MAU ratio | Daily habit strength | > 20% |
| D1 retention | First impression quality | > 30% |
| D7 retention | Habit formation | > 15% |
| D30 retention | Long-term engagement | > 10% |
| Session length | Content depth engagement | > 3 min |
| Paywall tap-through | Willingness to pay | > 5% |
| Guided journey completion | Content value | > 50% |

**How validation data adjusts forecasts:**
- If paywall tap-through > 10%: conversion assumptions may be too conservative — shift probability weight toward aggressive scenarios
- If D7 retention < 10%: core product needs iteration before committing marketing spend — delay launch timeline
- If session length < 1 min: daily verse alone is not compelling enough — add features before scaling
- If paywall tap-through < 2%: pricing or value proposition needs rethinking — adjust conversion rates downward

### Micro-Ad Audience Discovery (Target: Feb-Mar 2026)

| Metric | What It Tells Us | How It Adjusts Forecasts |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| CPM by platform | Where to spend $100K | Allocate budget to lowest-CPM, highest-engagement platform |
| Click-through rate | Creative effectiveness | Informs CAC assumptions below |
| Audience demographics | Who actually clicks | Validates or replaces assumed target demographic |
| Platform performance | Pinterest vs. Instagram vs. Facebook | Concentrates paid spend on best performer |

**Spend:** $50-100 total (founder-funded, pre-SAFE)

### Investor Story

With validation data, the investor pitch shifts from "Here's our plan" to "Here's our traction":
- "X thousand users on TestFlight, Y% return daily"
- "Z% tapped to subscribe before we even turned on payments"
- "Our best-performing ad audience is [demographic] on [platform] at $X CPM"
- "Users describe the app as [their words, not ours]"

This data closes SAFEs faster than projections alone.

## Q1 2027 Forecast

### User Acquisition Scenarios

| Scenario | Total Users | Probability | Weighted Users |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 300,000 | 25% | 75,000 |
| Moderate | 400,000 | 50% | 200,000 |
| Aggressive | 550,000 | 25% | 137,500 |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **412,500** |

### Conversion Rate Scenarios

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Probability | Weighted Rate |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 0.4% | 25% | 0.10% |
| Moderate | 0.6% | 50% | 0.30% |
| Aggressive | 1.0% | 25% | 0.25% |

## Q2 2027 Forecast

### User Acquisition Scenarios

| Scenario | Total Users | Probability | Weighted Users |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 380,000 | 25% | 95,000 |
| Moderate | 500,000 | 50% | 250,000 |
| Aggressive | 700,000 | 25% | 175,000 |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **520,000** |

**Rationale:** By Q2 2027, both iOS and Android are live for 6+ months. ASO has matured, marketing spend is optimized, word-of-mouth is compounding. Conservative assumes marketing underperforms; aggressive assumes a viral moment or PR hit.

### Conversion Rate Scenarios

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Probability | Weighted Rate |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 0.5% | 25% | 0.13% |
| Moderate | 0.8% | 50% | 0.40% |
| Aggressive | 1.3% | 25% | 0.33% |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **0.85%** |

**Rationale:** Conversion improves as the product matures — better onboarding, more guided journeys, social proof (reviews, testimonials), and optimized paywall placement. 0.8% moderate is conservative for a differentiated spiritual app (Insight Timer converts ~10% but with a massive free library; Waking Up likely converts higher due to Sam Harris brand).

### Q2 2027 Revenue Calculation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Weighted Users | 520,000 |
| Weighted Conversion | 0.85% |
| Paid Subscribers | 4,420 |
| Annual Revenue per Sub | $100 |
| **Q2 2027 ARR** | **$442,000** |
| Net ARR (after 30% commission) | **$309,400** |

## Q3 2027 Forecast

### User Acquisition Scenarios

| Scenario | Total Users | Probability | Weighted Users |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 480,000 | 20% | 96,000 |
| Moderate | 650,000 | 50% | 325,000 |
| Aggressive | 900,000 | 30% | 270,000 |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **691,000** |

**Rationale:** By Q3 2027 (12 months post-launch), the app has a track record. Probability shifts slightly toward aggressive as organic channels compound. Conservative accounts for market saturation or competitive response.

### Conversion Rate Scenarios

| Scenario | Conversion Rate | Probability | Weighted Rate |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 0.6% | 20% | 0.12% |
| Moderate | 1.0% | 50% | 0.50% |
| Aggressive | 1.8% | 30% | 0.54% |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **1.16%** |

**Rationale:** At 12 months, the product has been through multiple iterations. Best features have been identified via beta feedback. Conversion above 1% is realistic for a differentiated product with loyal users. Aggressive 1.8% reflects a scenario where guided journeys or a viral Rumi quote drives exceptional engagement.

### Q3 2027 Revenue Calculation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Weighted Users | 691,000 |
| Weighted Conversion | 1.16% |
| Paid Subscribers | 8,016 |
| Annual Revenue per Sub | $100 |
| **Q3 2027 ARR** | **$801,600** |
| Net ARR (after 30% commission) | **$561,120** |

## Annual Summary

| Period | Weighted ARR (Gross) | Weighted ARR (Net) | Confidence Level |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| End of Q4 2026 | $150,000 | $105,000 | Medium-High |
| End of Q1 2027 | $268,100 | $187,670 | Medium |
| End of Q2 2027 | $442,000 | $309,400 | Medium |
| End of Q3 2027 | $801,600 | $561,120 | Medium-Low |
| **End of 2027 (est.)** | **~$1,000,000** | **~$700,000** | Low (extrapolated) |
| **End of 2028 (est.)** | **~$2,500,000 - $4,000,000** | **~$1,750,000 - $2,800,000** | Very Low (speculative) |

**Note on 2028:** With Series A funding ($2M target at $10M pre-money), 2028 projections assume expanded marketing, Hafez/Shams platform expansion, and international markets. These are directional estimates for long-range planning only.

## Growth Rate Analysis

| Quarter | Weighted ARR | QoQ Growth |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Q4 2026 | $150,000 | - (launch) |
| Q1 2027 | $268,100 | +79% |
| Q2 2027 | $442,000 | +65% |
| Q3 2027 | $801,600 | +81% |

**Average quarterly growth: ~75%.** This is strong for a pre-seed app but reasonable given:
- Launching from zero (early growth rates are naturally high)
- Two platform launches (iOS + Android) in the first 6 months
- $100K marketing budget deployed across 12 months
- Rumi's existing global audience (built-in demand)

**Growth rate comparison:**
- Pattern app: 50% YoY (with zero marketing spend)
- Calm: -20% YoY downloads (declining)
- Headspace: -15% YoY subscribers (declining)
- Meditation app average (new entrant): 30-50% QoQ in first year

---

## Key Assumptions

### User Acquisition
- iOS launch: Q3 2026 (July target)
- Android launch: Q4 2026 (October target)
- Marketing spend: $100K allocated across 12 months, front-loaded around launches
- Organic growth: ASO for "Rumi," "Rumi poetry," "Masnavi," "spiritual companion" keywords
- PR campaign: Well+Good, Psychology Today, Lion's Roar, Mindful Magazine, Tricycle
- Social sharing: In-app quote sharing to Instagram, Twitter/X, WhatsApp
- Cultural moments: Sheb-i Arus (Dec 17), Nowruz (Mar 21), World Poetry Day (Mar 21)

### Conversion Drivers
- 0.5% conversion at launch (industry standard for freemium spiritual apps)
- 1.0% conversion at 12 months (conservative vs. Insight Timer's ~10%)
- 3-6% conversion at scale is aspirational target (2+ years)
- Premium triggers: Full Masnavi library, Guided Journeys, Shams of Tabriz, offline mode

### Revenue Assumptions
- $9.99/month or $96/year pricing
- ~$100 blended average per subscriber per year
- 60% annual / 40% monthly subscription mix
- Churn: 8-10% monthly for monthly subscribers, 30-40% annual for annual subscribers
- Net revenue retention: 70% of gross (after App Store commission)

### Churn Rate Modeling

| Subscriber Type | Monthly Churn | Annual Retention | Average Lifetime |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Monthly ($9.99/mo) | 10% | ~28% | ~10 months |
| Annual ($96/yr) | ~3%/month effective | ~65% | ~2.8 years |
| **Blended** | ~5.8% | ~50% | ~1.7 years |

**LTV Calculation:**
- Monthly subscriber LTV: 10 months x $9.99 = ~$100
- Annual subscriber LTV: 2.8 years x $96 = ~$269
- **Blended LTV: ~$170** (weighted 40/60)
- **Net LTV (after commission): ~$119**

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- At $50 blended CAC: 119/50 = **2.4:1** (needs improvement)
- At $30 blended CAC: 119/30 = **4.0:1** (healthy)
- **Target: $30-$40 CAC** through organic-heavy acquisition strategy

## Sensitivity Analysis

### If Conversion is 50% Lower Than Expected

| Quarter | Base ARR | Low Conversion ARR | Difference | Impact |
|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| Q4 2026 | $150,000 | $75,000 | -$75,000 | Delays break-even by ~3 months |
| Q1 2027 | $268,100 | $134,050 | -$134,050 | May need to reduce burn |
| Q2 2027 | $442,000 | $221,000 | -$221,000 | Bridge round may be needed |
| Q3 2027 | $801,600 | $400,800 | -$400,800 | Series A still viable but at lower valuation |

### If User Acquisition is 50% Lower Than Expected

| Quarter | Base ARR | Low Users ARR | Difference | Impact |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Q4 2026 | $150,000 | $75,000 | -$75,000 | Same as low conversion |
| Q1 2027 | $268,100 | $134,050 | -$134,050 | Reallocate marketing budget |
| Q2 2027 | $442,000 | $221,000 | -$221,000 | Focus on organic/ASO |
| Q3 2027 | $801,600 | $400,800 | -$400,800 | Extend runway, defer hires |

### If Both Conversion AND Acquisition are 50% Lower (Worst Case)

| Quarter | Base ARR | Worst Case ARR | Difference |
|---------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Q4 2026 | $150,000 | $37,500 | -$112,500 |
| Q1 2027 | $268,100 | $67,025 | -$201,075 |
| Q2 2027 | $442,000 | $110,500 | -$331,500 |
| Q3 2027 | $801,600 | $200,400 | -$601,200 |

**Worst case mitigation:** Even at 25% of projected revenue, the lean burn scenario ($15,589/month) provides 16 months of runway on $250K alone. The company can survive long enough to iterate and find product-market fit.

### Upside Scenario: Viral Moment

If a Rumi quote goes viral (social media, celebrity endorsement, news coverage):

| Metric | Base | Viral Upside |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Q4 2026 Users | 300,000 | 750,000+ |
| Conversion | 0.5% | 0.5% (same) |
| Paid Subscribers | 1,500 | 3,750+ |
| ARR | $150,000 | $375,000+ |

**Precedent:** Pattern app went from unknown to 30,000 downloads in one day with zero marketing when celebrities tweeted about it. Rumi has far broader cultural recognition.

---

## Risk Factors

### 1. App Store Approval Delays
- **Risk:** Apple or Google review process delays launch beyond Q3 2026
- **Probability:** Low (15%) — standard apps with no controversial content
- **Impact:** 1-3 month revenue delay; pre-launch marketing spend wasted
- **Mitigation:** Submit 6-8 weeks before target launch; have TestFlight beta as fallback

### 2. Marketing Channel Underperformance
- **Risk:** Paid social (Meta, Google) CPAs higher than expected; organic ASO slower than modeled
- **Probability:** Medium (35%) — common for new app categories
- **Impact:** User acquisition 30-50% below projections
- **Mitigation:** Diversify channels early (PR, partnerships, content marketing); set monthly CAC ceiling and reallocate budget to best performers

### 3. Competitive Response
- **Risk:** Calm, Headspace, or a new entrant launches a Rumi/poetry feature
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (20%) — unlikely to prioritize niche, but possible
- **Impact:** Shared audience attention; ASO keyword competition increases
- **Mitigation:** First-mover advantage with complete Masnavi (25,000 verses); depth is the moat — competitors can copy features but not spiritual authority

### 4. Economic Downturn
- **Risk:** Recession reduces discretionary spending on app subscriptions
- **Probability:** Medium (30%) — macroeconomic uncertainty in 2026-2027
- **Impact:** Lower conversion rates; longer sales cycles for premium
- **Mitigation:** Generous free tier maintains user base; spiritual content is counter-cyclical (people seek meaning during hardship)

### 5. Higher-Than-Expected Churn
- **Risk:** Monthly churn exceeds 12% (vs. modeled 10%)
- **Probability:** Medium (30%) — common for new apps before feature maturity
- **Impact:** LTV decreases, requiring either higher conversion or lower CAC
- **Mitigation:** Focus on annual subscriptions (lower churn), push notifications for daily engagement, guided journeys for retention

### 6. Platform Dependency
- **Risk:** Apple or Google changes commission rates, review policies, or payment rules
- **Probability:** Low (10%) — major policy changes are gradual
- **Impact:** Margin compression or feature restrictions
- **Mitigation:** Build web-based subscription option as alternative; monitor policy changes proactively

### 7. Content / Cultural Sensitivity
- **Risk:** Content is perceived as cultural appropriation or misrepresentation of Islamic/Sufi tradition
- **Probability:** Low (10%) — mitigated by John Wyrick's spiritual authority and authentic approach
- **Impact:** PR backlash, negative reviews, community opposition
- **Mitigation:** Scholarly translations alongside modern retellings; Islamic/Sufi context preserved; advisory relationships with Muslim community leaders

## Quarterly Revenue Targets for Team Tracking

Use these as internal goals. Report actuals against targets monthly.

| Quarter | Target ARR (Moderate) | Stretch ARR (Aggressive) | Floor ARR (Conservative) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Q4 2026 | $150,000 | $250,000 | $75,000 |
| Q1 2027 | $268,000 | $450,000 | $134,000 |
| Q2 2027 | $442,000 | $750,000 | $221,000 |
| Q3 2027 | $800,000 | $1,200,000 | $400,000 |

**Series A readiness signal:** Crossing $500K ARR with healthy conversion (>0.8%) and retention metrics positions the company well for a $2M Series A at $10M+ pre-money valuation.

---

## Notes

- **Probability weights should be adjusted based on TestFlight validation data (Feb-Mar 2026) BEFORE investor meetings** — do not present unvalidated assumptions
- Probability weights should continue to be adjusted monthly based on actual data once launched
- Review forecast with Ben Rewis at monthly sessions
- Update weighted averages quarterly
- Conservative scenario is the planning basis for cash management; moderate scenario is the target
- All figures are gross unless labeled "net" — always account for 30% App Store commission in cash planning
- Micro-ad data (CPM, click-through, demographics) should be incorporated into user acquisition assumptions as soon as available
