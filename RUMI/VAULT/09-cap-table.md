# Cap Table

Rumi App - Equity & Ownership Structure  
Last Updated: January 26, 2026

---

## Overview

Tracks ownership percentages, share classes, and equity allocation for all founders, advisors, and investors.

---

## Company Structure

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Entity Type | **DECISION NEEDED: C-Corp recommended** (standard for SAFE notes and VC funding; LLCs cannot issue SAFEs without conversion) |
| State of Incorporation | **DECISION NEEDED: Delaware recommended** (most investor-friendly jurisdiction, established corporate case law, no requirement to be physically present) |
| Date of Incorporation | **DECISION NEEDED** — backdate to founding activity or file fresh |
| Authorized Shares | 10,000,000 (standard for early-stage Delaware C-Corp) |
| Issued Shares | **DECISION NEEDED** — issued to founders per split below |
| Par Value | $0.0001 per share (standard) |

**Recommendation:** Incorporate as a Delaware C-Corp. This is the path of least resistance for SAFE notes, equity option pools, and future VC rounds. LLCs require conversion before issuing SAFEs or running a priced round — an unnecessary cost and delay. Use a service like Clerky, Stripe Atlas, or an attorney to file.

## Current Cap Table (Pre-Funding)

**DECISION NEEDED: Founder equity split.** The table below uses placeholder percentages. The team must agree on exact splits. For reference, here are common pre-seed patterns for a 4-person founding team:

| Pattern | CEO | CTO | COO | CDO | Pool | Rationale |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-----------|
| Equal | 21.25% | 21.25% | 21.25% | 21.25% | 15% | Equal risk, equal reward |
| Weighted to originator | 30% | 25% | 20% | 10% | 15% | Reflects idea origin + spiritual IP |
| Role-weighted | 25% | 25% | 22.5% | 12.5% | 15% | Tech + vision premium |

**Working example (using "Weighted to originator" — adjust after team decision):**

| Name | Role | Shares | Ownership % | Vesting | Cliff | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| John Wyrick | Founder/CEO | 3,000,000 | **[JW %]** | 4 years | 1 year | Originator, spiritual IP, 40yr teaching |
| Todd Bowden | Co-Founder/CTO | 2,500,000 | **[TB %]** | 4 years | 1 year | PhD, 11yr Apple dev, builds the product |
| Yalor Mewn | Co-Founder/COO | 2,000,000 | **[YM %]** | 4 years | 1 year | Ops, fundraising, startup experience |
| Stuart Paul | Founding Team/CDO | 1,000,000 | **[SP %]** | 4 years | 1 year | Brand, design, contemplative experience |
| Employee Option Pool | Reserved | 1,500,000 | **15%** | - | - | For future hires (UI/UX, Marketing, Android dev, etc.) |
| **TOTAL** | | **10,000,000** | **100%** | | | |

**Note:** Share counts above are illustrative based on 10M authorized. Percentages are the decisions that matter — shares are calculated from the agreed split.

## Vesting Schedule Details

All founders on industry standard vesting:
- **Vesting Period:** 4 years
- **Cliff:** 1 year (25% vests at cliff date)
- **Monthly Vesting:** Remaining 75% vests in equal monthly installments over 36 months (2.083%/month)
- **Acceleration:** **DECISION NEEDED** — Recommended terms below

### Recommended Acceleration Terms

| Trigger | Effect | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Single Trigger** (Change of Control) | 25% of unvested shares accelerate immediately | Protects founders if company is acquired early |
| **Double Trigger** (CoC + termination within 12 months) | 100% of unvested shares accelerate | Full protection if acquirer terminates founders post-acquisition |

**Industry standard for pre-seed:** Double trigger at 100% is most common and most investor-friendly. Single trigger can concern investors because it rewards founders for leaving after an acquisition.

### Vesting Start Dates

| Name | Vesting Start Date | Cliff Date | Fully Vested Date |
|------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| John Wyrick | **[DECISION NEEDED]** | +12 months from start | +48 months from start |
| Todd Bowden | **[DECISION NEEDED]** | +12 months from start | +48 months from start |
| Yalor Mewn | **[DECISION NEEDED]** | +12 months from start | +48 months from start |
| Stuart Paul | **[DECISION NEEDED]** | +12 months from start | +48 months from start |

**Recommendation:** Use the date of incorporation or the date founder agreements are signed, whichever is earlier. If founders have been working since mid-2025, consider backdating vesting start to when meaningful work began — this gives credit for time already invested. Discuss with legal counsel.

## Advisor Equity

| Advisor | Equity % | Shares | Vesting | Role | Agreement Date |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|------|----------------|
| Ben Rewis | **[DECISION NEEDED]** | - | 2 years, no cliff, monthly | Strategic Advisor (monthly sessions through 2027) | **[DATE]** |

### Advisor Equity Benchmarks (FAST Agreement Standards)

| Engagement Level | Pre-Seed Standard | Ben's Profile |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Light (1-2 hrs/month, introductions) | 0.25% - 0.50% | - |
| Medium (2-5 hrs/month, strategic guidance) | 0.50% - 1.00% | Closer to Ben's engagement |
| Heavy (5+ hrs/month, operational involvement) | 1.00% - 2.00% | - |

**Recommendation:** Ben is engaged at the "Medium" level — monthly 2-hour working sessions through 2027, strategic guidance on fundraising, organizational process, and financial planning. **0.50% - 1.00%** is appropriate. Standard advisor vesting: 2 years, no cliff, monthly vesting.

---

## Employee Option Pool

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Pool Size | **15%** of fully diluted (1,500,000 shares) |
| Shares Reserved | 1,500,000 |
| Shares Granted | 0 (pre-launch) |
| Shares Available | 1,500,000 |
| Strike Price | FMV at time of grant (409A valuation required before granting) |

**Note on 409A Valuation:** Before granting any options from the pool, the company must obtain a 409A valuation to establish fair market value. At pre-seed, this is typically very low ($0.01-$0.10/share). Services like Carta, Pulley, or Eqvista offer 409A valuations for $500-$2,000.

### Planned Allocations from Pool

| Role | Planned Allocation | Shares (est.) | Vesting | Hire Timeline |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| UI/UX Designer | 0.50% - 1.00% | 50,000 - 100,000 | 4yr/1yr cliff | Q3 2026 |
| Marketing Specialist | 0.50% - 1.00% | 50,000 - 100,000 | 4yr/1yr cliff | Q3 2026 |
| Android Developer | 0.75% - 1.50% | 75,000 - 150,000 | 4yr/1yr cliff | Q4 2026 |
| Content Writer (Part-time) | 0.10% - 0.25% | 10,000 - 25,000 | 4yr/1yr cliff | Post Series A |
| Customer Support | 0.10% - 0.25% | 10,000 - 25,000 | 4yr/1yr cliff | Post Series A |
| **Total Planned** | **~2.0% - 4.0%** | ~200,000 - 400,000 | | |
| **Remaining Unallocated** | **~11.0% - 13.0%** | ~1,100,000 - 1,300,000 | | Series A hires |

**Note:** Early-stage hires receive more equity to compensate for risk. Post-Series A hires receive less equity but higher salaries. The 15% pool is sized to cover pre-seed through Series A hiring needs.

## SAFE Terms (Pending Investment)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Instrument | SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) — YC Post-Money SAFE recommended |
| Amount | $250,000 |
| Valuation Cap | $4,000,000 (post-money) |
| Discount | **DECISION NEEDED** — 20% is standard; some pre-seed SAFEs use cap-only (no discount) |
| MFN (Most Favored Nation) | **Recommended: Yes** — standard protection for early investors; means if you issue a later SAFE with better terms, this investor gets those terms too |
| Pro-rata Rights | **Recommended: Yes** — gives SAFE holders the right to invest in future rounds to maintain their ownership percentage; standard and expected by angels |

### SAFE Conversion Scenarios

**Using YC Post-Money SAFE at $4M cap:**

With a post-money SAFE, the $250K investor gets exactly $250K / $4M = **6.25%** at conversion, regardless of the priced round valuation. This is the cleaner, more modern approach.

| Scenario | Round Pre-Money | SAFE Investor Gets | Dilution to Founders |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Seed at $4M pre | $4,000,000 | 6.25% | From SAFE only |
| Seed at $6M pre | $6,000,000 | 6.25% | From SAFE only |
| Seed at $8M pre | $8,000,000 | 6.25% | From SAFE only |

**If using Pre-Money SAFE at $4M cap (alternative):**

| Scenario | Round Pre-Money | Post-Money | SAFE Ownership |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Seed at $4M | $4,000,000 | $4,250,000 | 5.88% |
| Seed at $6M | $6,000,000 | $6,250,000 | 4.00% |
| Seed at $8M | $8,000,000 | $8,250,000 | 3.03% |

**Recommendation:** Use the **YC Post-Money SAFE**. It is the current standard (2025-2026), simpler to model, and most investors expect it. The investor knows exactly what they're getting (6.25%), and you know exactly how much dilution you're taking.

## Pro-Forma Cap Table (Post $250K SAFE Conversion)

**Using Post-Money SAFE at $4M cap, 15% option pool, illustrative founder split:**

| Name | Role | Pre-SAFE % | Post-SAFE % |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| John Wyrick | Founder/CEO | **[JW %]** | [JW %] x 0.9375 |
| Todd Bowden | Co-Founder/CTO | **[TB %]** | [TB %] x 0.9375 |
| Yalor Mewn | Co-Founder/COO | **[YM %]** | [YM %] x 0.9375 |
| Stuart Paul | Founding Team/CDO | **[SP %]** | [SP %] x 0.9375 |
| Employee Option Pool | Reserved | **15.00%** | 14.06% |
| SAFE Investors | Investors | 0% | **6.25%** |
| **TOTAL** | | **100%** | **100%** |

**How to calculate:** Each pre-SAFE holder is diluted by 6.25% proportionally. Multiply pre-SAFE % by 0.9375 (i.e., 1 - 0.0625) to get post-SAFE %.

---

## Dilution Modeling

### Series A Scenario ($2M raise at $10M Pre-Money Valuation)

Assumes SAFE has already converted. New Series A option pool top-up of 5% (bringing total pool to ~18-19%).

| Shareholder | Post-SAFE % | Post-Series A % | Dilution |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Founders (combined) | ~79.69% | ~60.95% | -18.74 pts |
| Employee Pool (original) | 14.06% | 10.76% | -3.30 pts |
| New Option Pool Top-Up | 0% | 5.00% | - |
| SAFE Investors | 6.25% | 4.78% | -1.47 pts |
| Series A Investors | 0% | 16.67% | - |
| Series A Option Pool Increase | 0% | 1.84% | - |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **100%** | |

**Key takeaway for founders:** From founding to post-Series A, total founder equity goes from ~85% to ~61%. This is normal and healthy. Each round dilutes everyone proportionally, but the value of each percentage point increases as the company grows.

### Value Per Percentage Point Over Time

| Stage | Valuation | 1% Value |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Incorporation | ~$0 | ~$0 |
| Post-SAFE ($4M cap) | $4,000,000 | $40,000 |
| Series A ($10M pre) | $12,000,000 | $120,000 |
| Series B ($40M pre, hypothetical) | $40,000,000 | $400,000 |

## Key Terms to Define

### Founder Agreements
- [ ] Founder vesting agreements signed — **NEEDED: Use Clerky or attorney**
- [ ] IP assignment agreements signed — **CRITICAL: All content, code, and designs must be assigned to the company. Without this, the company doesn't own its product.**
- [ ] Non-compete/non-solicit terms — **See Governance Doc 10**
- [ ] Buyback provisions for departing founders — **See Governance Doc 10**

### Corporate Governance
- [ ] Board composition defined — **Recommendation: 3-person board (JW, TB, YM) at pre-seed; expand to 5 with investor seat at Series A**
- [ ] Voting rights specified — **Standard: 1 share = 1 vote for Common Stock**
- [ ] Drag-along/tag-along rights — **Standard: Include both. Drag-along lets majority force a sale; tag-along lets minority join a sale at same terms**
- [ ] Information rights — **Standard: Quarterly financial updates to SAFE holders, monthly to board**

### Protective Provisions (Standard for SAFE/Seed Investors)
- [ ] Consent required for: issuing new equity classes, changing authorized shares, amending charter, declaring dividends, taking on debt above threshold, selling the company
- [ ] These are negotiated at priced round, not SAFE stage — SAFE holders typically get no protective provisions until conversion

## Document Checklist

| Document | Status | Location | Action Needed |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Stock Purchase Agreements | Not Started | - | Draft after incorporation; use Clerky templates |
| Founder Restricted Stock Agreements | Not Started | - | Execute simultaneously with incorporation |
| Advisor Agreements | Not Started | - | Draft for Ben Rewis; use FAST Agreement template |
| Option Plan (for pool) | Not Started | - | Adopt at board level after incorporation |
| SAFE Documents | Not Started | - | Use YC SAFE template (free at ycombinator.com) |
| 83(b) Elections Filed | Not Started | - | **CRITICAL: Must file within 30 days of stock grant. Missing this deadline is irreversible and creates significant tax liability.** |

## Recommended Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| **Carta** | Cap table management, 409A valuations, equity grants | ~$3,000/yr at seed |
| **Pulley** | Cap table management (startup-friendly pricing) | Free for <25 stakeholders |
| **Clerky** | Incorporation, founder docs, SAFE generation | ~$800-$2,500 one-time |
| **YC SAFE Generator** | SAFE document creation | Free |
| **FAST Agreement** | Advisor equity agreements | Free template |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Pulley** (free tier) for cap table tracking and **Clerky** for incorporation and legal docs. Move to Carta at Series A when 409A valuations and option grants become necessary.
