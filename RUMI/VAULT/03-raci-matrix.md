# RACI Matrix

Rumi App - Responsibility Assignment  
Last Updated: January 26, 2026

---

## Overview

Defines who is **R**esponsible, **A**ccountable, **C**onsulted, and **I**nformed for each key task.

- **R (Responsible):** Does the work
- **A (Accountable):** Final decision maker, "one throat to choke" (only ONE per task)
- **C (Consulted):** Provides input before decision
- **I (Informed):** Notified after decision

**Per Ben Rewis (Jan 21, 2026):** Every task must have exactly one "A." If accountability is unclear, that's a governance issue to resolve immediately. Build this matrix in ClickUp for the next monthly meeting.

## Resolved Questions

### Product Owner / CPO
**Resolution:** Yalor Mewn serves as **interim Product Owner** in addition to COO role. This is appropriate for pre-seed — a dedicated PO hire is premature until post-Series A when the team and product complexity justifies it. Yalor's accountability for "what gets built" is documented in the Product Owner Charter (Doc 07).

**Trigger to revisit:** If product decisions consistently conflict with operational duties, or if the team grows beyond 8 people, consider a dedicated PO hire.

### Customer Support Owner
**Resolution:** Pre-launch, no dedicated support needed. Post-launch plan:
- **Q3-Q4 2026 (launch):** Yalor (A) handles support triage; Todd (R) handles technical bugs
- **Post Series A:** Hire dedicated Customer Support role reporting to Yalor

### Dedicated UI/UX Designer
**Resolution:** Stuart (SP) handles all design through pre-seed. A dedicated UI/UX designer hire (reporting to SP) is planned for Q3 2026 with funding. Until then, SP is both strategic design lead and hands-on designer.

### Marketing Professional
**Resolution:** No dedicated hire until Q3 2026 with funding. Currently:
- Yalor (A) owns marketing strategy
- Stuart (R) creates marketing assets
- Post-funding: Marketing Specialist hire reports to Yalor, dotted line to Stuart for brand consistency

## RACI Health Check

Review these monthly:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Every row has exactly one "A" | Yes |
| No founder has "A" on more than 40% of tasks | Check quarterly |
| No critical tasks are missing from the matrix | Review monthly |
| "R" assignments match actual workload | Validate at sprint planning |
| New tasks added as company evolves | Ongoing |

---

## Notes

- Build this matrix in ClickUp before next monthly meeting with Ben
- Review and update quarterly
- One and ONLY one "A" per row — this is non-negotiable
- If accountability is unclear on any new task, resolve it at the next Founder Sync
- When new team members are added, update this matrix to include them
- This matrix drives the organizational chart and hiring priorities
