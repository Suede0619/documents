## Open Questions / Gaps

1. [WHO IS PRODUCT OWNER/CPO?] - Currently showing YM as accountable for product decisions
2. [DEDICATED UI/UX DESIGNER HIRE] - SP currently handling, need dedicated resource
3. [MARKETING PROFESSIONAL HIRE] - Currently split across team
4. [CUSTOMER SUPPORT OWNER] - Not yet assigned

## Notes

- Build this matrix in ClickUp for next monthly meeting with Ben
- Review and update quarterly
- One and ONLY one "A" per row
- If accountability is unclear, that's a governance issue to resolve
