## Planned Hires (with $250K Funding)

Budget source: $50,000 Team allocation from Use of Funds.

### Immediate Priority (Q3 2026 — with funding)

| Role | Reports To | Dotted Line | Annual Salary Range | Equity Range | Timeline |
|------|------------|-------------|--------------------| -------------|----------|
| UI/UX Designer | Stuart Paul (CDO) | Yalor (product priorities) | $55,000 - $75,000 | 0.50% - 1.00% from pool | Q3 2026 |
| Marketing Specialist | Yalor Mewn (COO) | Stuart (brand consistency) | $50,000 - $70,000 | 0.50% - 1.00% from pool | Q3 2026 |

**Budget note:** At $50K total team budget, hiring both roles full-time at market rate is not feasible for 12 months. Options:
- **Option A:** Hire both part-time/contract ($25K each for ~6 months) — maintains breadth
- **Option B:** Hire one full-time ($50K for 12 months) and the other as contractor — depth in one area
- **Option C:** Hire both full-time with equity-heavy compensation (lower salary + higher equity) — startup-standard

**Recommendation:** Option C — startup-stage hires expect below-market salary offset by meaningful equity (0.75-1.0%). Target $30K-$40K salary + 0.75-1.0% equity for each role.

### Future Hires (Post Series A — $2M raise)

| Role | Reports To | Salary Range | Timeline | Priority |
|------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Android Developer | Todd Bowden (CTO) | $90,000 - $130,000 | Q4 2026 - Q1 2027 | High |
| Content Writer (Part-time) | John Wyrick (CEO) | $40,000 - $55,000 | Post Series A | Medium |
| Customer Support | Yalor Mewn (COO) | $35,000 - $50,000 | Post Series A | Medium |
| Data/Growth Analyst | Yalor Mewn (COO) | $70,000 - $95,000 | Post Series A | Medium |
| Community Manager | Yalor Mewn (COO) | $45,000 - $60,000 | Post Series A | Low |

**Salary benchmarks based on:** Remote-first startup compensation for non-FAANG markets (2025-2026 data). Bay Area/NYC would be 30-50% higher.

## Notes

- Strategy drives structure drives people — never the reverse (per Ben Rewis)
- Org chart should be updated with each hire
- Review quarterly with team
- All new hires should have clear position in RACI matrix before starting
- Remote-first structure assumed; co-location optional
