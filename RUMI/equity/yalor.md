# My View of Start Ups

## The Founder Commitment

The way I view being a founder is not just a title or an ownership stake; it is a commitment to carry a company through uncertainty.

Since I am joining before product-market validation this is considered a high risk endeavour, yet joining at this stage also signals strong founder alignment for our future investors.

It is my belief that founders are all responsible for holding the vision when there is no validation, making decisions with incomplete information, and absorbing risk—financial, reputational, and emotional—long before the outcomes are clear. This includes showing up consistently, taking accountability when things break, and staying in the work when momentum is slow or invisible.

As a co-founder I am personally motivated by taking this risk and committing to find solutions to the many challenges we will face along the way to making Rumi.app a household name, downloaded and loved by millions of spiritual seekers world-wide.

## What I Bring to the Table

As a founder I bring a deep network of collaborators, operators, and funders that help accelerate the company's reach. Bringing me in becomes a force multiplier: not just doing the work, but making it easier for both of you by opening doors, attracting talent, and aligning the right people at the right moment. My responsibility is to actively deploy that network in service of the Rumi.app's growth—strategically, generously, and with long-term trust in mind.

My contribution as a founder goes beyond execution. I bring direct startup experience, including helping companies move from early concept through MVP and into fundable narratives. I understand how to position a company for capital—how to translate product vision into language that investors trust, how to manage the psychology of fundraising, and how to maintain credibility through the long arc of a raise. This will allow us to avoid early missteps that cost Rumi.app time, leverage, and optionality.

I am also ready to take the responsibility for being a public-facing representative of the brand. This means carrying the story with clarity and integrity—on podcasts, panels, investor calls, partnerships, and in culture-shaping moments where perception matters as much as product. As founders I see us not only building internally, but constantly shaping how the company is understood externally, often before the product speaks for itself.

Together, these responsibilities reflect the reasoning for my founder's equity request: I believe this aligns the company's ownership with the people carrying the greatest risk, the longest horizon, and the broadest accountability for what the company becomes.
