# The Rumi App - Investor Deck Copy (Final)

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE

# The Rumi App

**A Spiritual Wisdom Companion for the Modern World**

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

# Rumi is Everywhere - But Nowhere Fully Embodied

### The Fragmentation Crisis

In a world hungry for meaning, millions turn to Rumi daily.
Yet what they find are fragments:

- Quotes without context - inspiring, but shallow
- Translations without guidance - beautiful, but disconnected
- Social media noise - toxic environments antithetical to spiritual absorption
- No structured path through the Masnavi's 25,000 couplets

### The Insight

People don't want more content. They want a teacher.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY

# The Most-Read Poet Meets the Most Underserved Market

### Rumi's Global Reach

- #1 best-selling poet in the United States since the 1990s
- Most widely read poet in the world - BBC Culture
- 5 million daily searches for Rumi quotes
- Universal appeal - cross-cultural, interfaith, secular-friendly

### The Mindfulness App Market

- $6.2 billion global market as of 2024 with a CAGR of 15%+ through 2030, including corporate wellness and emerging markets
- 4M+ daily active users across Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer
- Critical gap: authentic, text-based spiritual guidance

### The Whitespace

No app has created a daily relationship with the depth and authenticity of classical mystical poetry such as Rumi.

---

---

## SLIDE 9: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

# The Market Gap We Fill

### The Competition / Our Differentiation

- ✓ Authentic source texts - not watered-down interpretations
- ✓ Structured spiritual path - not random inspiration
- ✓ Singular focus - deep, not broad
- ✓ Non-clinical - mystical, not therapeutic
- ✓ Beautiful, contemplative design - sanctuary, not feed

**We are the only app that treats Rumi as a teacher, not a quote database.**

### Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Calm | 4-6 million users, strong brand, good sleep stories | No textual depth, generic meditation, no spiritual tradition |
| Headspace | 3-4 million users, clinical credibility, stress reduction | Too therapeutic, lacks mystical or spiritual depth |
| Insight Timer | 2-4 million users, world's largest free meditation library | Overwhelming choice, no curation or structure |
| Waking Up | 300-500K users, intellectual depth, philosophical | Too abstract and academic for casual users |

## SLIDE 10: THE PLATFORM VISION

# Rumi Is the Gateway - Not the End

### The Broader Mission

This app is the first expression of a global platform:

A digital home for the world's ascended masters — from original sources, with integrity and care.

Each master launches in the existing app. Together, they form a self-organizing ecosystem that scales through replication, not dilution.

### Future Expansion

**In Development:**
- Hafez (Persian mystic poet)
- Shams of Tabriz (Rumi's teacher)

**Roadmap:**
- Attar - Jami - Firdousi (Persian tradition)
- Kabir - Mirabai (Indian mystics)
- Basho (Japanese Zen)
- Meister Eckhart - Teresa of Avila - John of the Cross (Christian Mystics)

### Why This Matters to Investors

Platform optionality. Repeatable model. Expanding TAM with each tradition we honor.

Each tradition becomes a change-maker — channeling resources and wisdom to address humanity's meaning crisis at scale.

## SLIDE 13: SOHBET — A NEW SOCIAL PARADIGM

# From Feed to Field — Social Built on Presence

### The Problem with Social

Traditional platforms optimize for speed, outrage, and performance.
People don't leave better. They leave more reactive.

### Sohbet: The Ancient Alternative

**Sohbet** is the Sufi art of spiritual companionship — transformation through presence, not persuasion.

The Rumi App will introduce a social layer designed not for engagement, but for coherence.

### How It Works

- **Sohbet Circles** — Small groups (3-12) in guided, turn-based conversation around shared themes: grief, surrender, forgiveness, longing
- **Rumi AI Presence** — A field-holder, not a chatbot. Opens with centering, asks one heart-oriented question, holds space with silence
- **Sahib al-Dil (Guardian of the Heart)** — AI-first moderation that coaches users toward wise speech before a message enters the shared field. Not censorship — capacity-building.

### What Makes This Defensible

- Users are trained in emotional intelligence over time — the system measures reduction in reactive speech
- No engagement traps: no likes, no comments, no pile-ons
- Success metric is felt clarity, not time-on-screen
- Scales through AI guardianship across thousands of circles simultaneously

### The Vision

A counterenvironment where people come to remember themselves — not perform themselves.

**Sohbet is the method. Adab is the technology. Presence is the product.**
