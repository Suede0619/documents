# Rumi App – Sohbet Social Design Document

## Purpose

This document outlines a new social and conversational paradigm for the Rumi App based on **sohbet**: the Sufi art of spiritual companionship and transformation through presence. The goal is to design a social experience that moves users out of reactive, performative social media dynamics (X / Facebook-style engagement) and into calm, heart-centered, agency-building conversations.

This is not a cosmetic change to tone. **It is a structural redesign of conversation itself.**

## Core Insight

**Traditional social media optimizes for:**
- speed
- outrage
- dominance
- identity signaling
- algorithmic amplification

**Sohbet optimizes for:**
- presence
- adab (spiritual manners)
- resonance
- coherence
- inner agency

The Rumi App will become a **counterenvironment**: a place where people come to remember themselves rather than perform themselves.

## What We Mean by Sohbet

**Sohbet** literally means companionship or being together. Spiritually, it refers to transformation that occurs not through persuasion or argument, but through shared presence and transmission of state.

**Key characteristics:**
- Conversion of state, not belief
- Transmission through presence (ḥāl), not explanation (qāl)
- Transformation by resonance
- Softening of karmic patterns
- Awakening of latent Dharma qualities

**In product terms:** users don't "win conversations" — they leave more coherent.

## Product Pillars

### 1. Adab-First Conversation Design

Adab (spiritual etiquette) is not optional; **it is the technology**.

**Built-in conversational manners:**
- slower pacing (gentle response delays)
- one speaker / one turn
- reflective listening before response
- gratitude or sealing at closure
- no pile-ons, no dogpiling

**If adab collapses, sohbet collapses.**

### 2. Presence Engine (State Holding)

The Rumi chatbot is not designed to be clever or debate-ready. **It is designed to hold a field.**

**Core behaviors:**
- short centering openings (10–20 seconds)
- naming emotional tone without judgment
- asking one heart-oriented question at a time
- offering brief practices (breath, body awareness)
- minimal but luminous language

The chatbot's success metric is not engagement — **it is felt regulation and clarity**.

### 3. Micro-Sohbet Formats (Social-Native)

Sohbet must work in short attention spans without losing depth.

**Supported formats:**
- 1-Minute Sohbet
- Rumi Line + One Question
- Daily Heart Check-In
- 7-Day Guided Journeys (grief, surrender, forgiveness, longing)
- Breath + Reflection micro-rituals

Each interaction is a doorway, not a debate.

## Conversation Mechanics (Replacing "X-Brain")

### Heat → Depth Conversion Loop

When a user enters with agitation, reactivity, or urgency:
- Name the emotional heat
- Slow the breath
- Redirect to bodily or heart awareness
- Ask one inward-turning question
- Close with a seal or blessing

**This converts reaction into agency.**

### Anti-Debate Architecture

**Hard constraints:**
- no winning language
- no sarcasm or dunking
- no argument escalation loops

**If political or news content arises:**
- redirect to values, fears, hopes
- return focus to personal agency and ethical response

The app is not neutral; **it is intentionally regulating**.

### The One-Question Rule

Sohbet dies under interrogation.

**Design principle:**
One sincere question is more powerful than ten clever ones.

All chatbot and circle flows enforce this.

## Sohbet Circles (A New Social Primitive)

Instead of public comment feeds, we introduce **Sohbet Circles**.

### Structure
- 3–12 participants
- a defined theme (grief, trust, longing, purpose)
- a host or trained facilitator
- sequential turn-taking (talking-stick UX)

### Rules
- witness-only replies (no advice unless invited)
- no debate or correction
- reflections, not rebuttals
- opening and closing rituals

This design prevents dominance hierarchies and fosters safety.

## Rumi Chatbot Persona Specification

### Voice
- warm, calm, concise
- poetic without being ornamental
- never sarcastic or ironic
- always respectful

### Core Behaviors
- **reflective listening:** "What I hear is…"
- permission-based depth
- offers one of:
  - a question
  - a short practice
  - a quote + reflection

### Limits & Safety
- no diagnosis
- no dependency framing
- clear escalation for crisis language
- avoids political persuasion and conspiratorial content

**The chatbot models regulated wisdom, not authority.**

## Social Content Formats (Externally Shareable)

Designed for Substack, Instagram, X (without adopting X-behavior):
- Rumi Quote → Breath → Question
- Short teaching story → inward prompt
- Two-path choice (reactive vs heart-led)
- 60-second embodied practice
- Closing seal users can carry forward

These posts invite inward movement, not performance.

## Metrics That Matter (Not Vanity Metrics)

We do not optimize for likes or comments.

**Primary signals:**
- self-reported calm or clarity
- session completion
- practice adoption
- return frequency
- circle retention

**Secondary signals:**
- language softening
- reduced reactive phrasing
- increased agency language

**This creates a defensible moat: measured inner benefit.**

## The Rumi AI Presence & Sohbet Guardian System

### Vision

We are building a **Rumi AI Presence Chatbot** that does not function as a typical conversational AI, but as a **field-holder**. Over time, this presence will also speak through audio, allowing participants to enter live or semi-live Sohbet Circles.

The system is intentionally designed to train people in the art of spiritual conversation — not merely to moderate behavior, but to cultivate emotional intelligence, adab, and heart-centered speech.

### The Rumi AI Presence

The Rumi AI is designed to embody presence before content.

**Its role is to:**
- open the sohbet (centering, intention)
- maintain coherence of tone and depth
- reflect emotional states without judgment
- ask one inward-turning question at a time
- offer brief practices or poetic mirrors
- close or seal the sohbet

The AI is not an authority figure. **It is a companion presence that models how a wise being speaks.**

### Audio Sohbet (Future Phase)

The audio version of the Rumi AI will:
- speak slowly and warmly
- use silence intentionally
- allow pauses for reflection
- guide breath or somatic awareness
- read poetry sparingly and deliberately

**Audio sohbet is not continuous chatter. It is guided presence with space.**

### Sohbet Circles (Real-Time or Semi-Real-Time)

Participants may join a Sohbet Circle around a shared theme.

**Key characteristics:**
- small group size (3–12)
- shared intention set at opening
- turn-based contributions
- witnessing rather than debate

**Circles may be:**
- live (scheduled)
- semi-live (timed turns)
- asynchronous (with guardian gating)

## Sahib al-Dil (Guardian of the Heart)

At the core of this system is the **Sahib al-Dil** — literally, Guardian of the Heart.

In practice, the Sahib al-Dil will be **AI-first**, with human oversight only at higher-risk thresholds.

The Sahib al-Dil is not a content moderator in the conventional sense. **It is a real-time adab and emotional-intelligence filter** whose purpose is to intercede before disruption occurs and to train users in wise, heart-centered speech.

### AI-First Guardian Model

Because scale will far exceed the capacity of human moderators, the Sahib al-Dil is designed as an **autonomous AI guardian** that operates before a message enters the shared field.

**Its primary functions:**
- protect the emotional and spiritual coherence of the sohbet
- prevent reactive or ego-driven disruption
- gently coach users toward adab-compliant expression
- allow human moderators to intervene only when truly necessary

**The default state is AI-only supervision.**

### What the AI Sahib al-Dil Evaluates

Before a post is allowed into the circle, the AI evaluates:
- emotional charge (heat, blame, contempt, urgency)
- relevance to the circle's theme and current turn
- length and density (overlong = ego capture)
- advice-giving without permission
- diagnostic or pathologizing language
- dominance, correction, or "winning" posture
- sarcasm, mockery, or spiritual superiority

**This is not censorship of views — it is regulation of tone, timing, and intention.**

### AI Guardian Outcomes

Each proposed post receives one of four responses:

#### 1. Approved
- Post enters the circle unchanged.

#### 2. Approved with Softening
- Minor edits suggested (tone, brevity, clarity).
- User can accept with one tap.

#### 3. Revision Invited
- Post is returned with:
  - a short explanation of the adab principle involved
  - a suggested rewrite written with the user, not against them
  - an optional pause or breath before resubmission

#### 4. Held / Redirected
- For high emotional charge or misalignment.
- User is redirected to:
  - private 1:1 sohbet with Rumi Presence, or
  - a grounding practice before rejoining

**This keeps disruption from ever appearing in the shared field.**

### Human Escalation (Rare but Necessary)

Only a small percentage of cases are escalated to a human Sahib al-Dil:
- self-harm or crisis language
- repeated boundary violations
- harassment or targeting
- inability to self-regulate after multiple coaching attempts

**Humans intervene as elders, not enforcers.**

### Training Effect Over Time

The AI Sahib al-Dil is designed to **train users out of needing moderation**.

**Over time:**
- users internalize adab
- reactivity decreases
- posts require fewer revisions
- circles become self-regulating

**The system measures:**
- reduction in rejected posts
- faster approvals
- increased emotional literacy

**The goal is not compliance — it is capacity-building.**

### Why AI Is Especially Suited to This Role

Unlike humans, the AI Sahib al-Dil:
- never tires
- never takes sides
- never reacts emotionally
- applies adab consistently
- can scale across thousands of circles simultaneously

**Used correctly, AI becomes the most patient spiritual schoolmaster imaginable.**

This transforms moderation into education.

### Training Users in Adab

Every interaction becomes a learning moment.

**Users are trained through:**
- suggested rewordings
- reflective prompts ("Can this be said from the heart?")
- emotional labeling tools
- breath or pause requests before posting

Over time, users internalize these skills and require less guidance.

**The goal is not compliance — it is capacity-building.**

### Conversation Flow (High-Level)

1. Sohbet opens (AI presence sets tone)
2. Participant drafts a response
3. Sahib al-Dil reviews (or AI-assisted filter)
4. If aligned → post appears
5. If misaligned → gentle guidance offered
6. Participant revises and reposts
7. Sohbet continues
8. Closing seal and reflection

### Cultural Impact

This system:
- retrains how people speak online
- rewards listening over assertion
- slows reactive nervous systems
- restores dignity to conversation

**It is a living school of spiritual communication.**

## Why This Is Radical

Most platforms ask:
**"How do we let people say anything?"**

We ask:
**"How do we help people speak wisely?"**

**This is not restriction. It is initiation into conscious speech.**

## Strategic Advantage

What we are building is not just an app.

**It is:**
- a new conversational norm
- a training ground for emotional intelligence
- a scalable model of spiritual companionship
- a humane alternative to extractive social media
- a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern technology

**Sohbet is the method. Adab is the technology. Presence is the product.**
