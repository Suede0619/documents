## SLIDE 1: TITLE

# The Rumi App

**A Spiritual Wisdom Companion for the Modern World**

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

# Rumi is Everywhere - But Nowhere Fully Embodied

### The Fragmentation Crisis

In a world hungry for meaning, millions turn to Rumi daily.
Yet what they find are fragments:

- Quotes without context - inspiring, but shallow
- Translations without guidance - beautiful, but disconnected
- Social media noise - toxic environments antithetical to spiritual absorption
- No structured path through the Masnavi's 25,000 verses

### The Insight

People don't want more content. They want a teacher.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY

# The Most-Read Poet Meets the Most Underserved Market

### Rumi's Global Reach

- #1 best-selling poet in the United States since the 1990s
- Most widely read poet in the world - BBC Culture
- 5 million daily searches for Rumi quotes
- Universal appeal - cross-cultural, interfaith, secular-friendly

### The Mindfulness App Market

- 6.2 billion dollar global market as of 2024 with a CAGR of 15%+ by 2030 including corporate wellness and emerging markets
- 4M+ daily active users across Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer
- Critical gap: authentic, text-based spiritual guidance

### The Whitespace

No app has created a daily relationship with the depth and authenticity of classical mystical poetry such as Rumi.

## SLIDE 11: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

# The Market Gap We Fill

### The Competition / Our Differentiation

- ✓ Authentic source texts - not watered-down interpretations
- ✓ Structured spiritual path - not random inspiration
- ✓ Singular focus - deep, not broad
- ✓ Non-clinical - mystical, not therapeutic
- ✓ Beautiful, contemplative design - sanctuary, not feed

**We are the only app that treats Rumi as a teacher, not a quote database.**

### Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Calm | 4-6 million users, strong brand, good sleep stories | No textual depth, generic meditation, no spiritual tradition |
| Headspace | 3-4 million users, clinical credibility, stress reduction | Too therapeutic, lacks mystical or spiritual depth |
| Insight Timer | 2-4 million users, worlds largest free meditation library | Overwhelming choice, no curation or structure |
| Waking Up | 300-500K users, Intellectual depth, philosophical | Too abstract and academic for casual users |
