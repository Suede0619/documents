**Designer:** Suede
**Date:** December 29, 2024

## DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR THE FUNDRAISING DECK

### 1. **COLOR PALETTE**
- Primary color(s) - for headlines, key elements
- Secondary color(s) - for accents, callouts
- Background colors - light and possibly dark variants
- Data visualization colors - for charts, graphs, tables
- Text colors - body, headings, captions

**Considerations:**
- Contemplative/spiritual aesthetic + professional credibility
- Avoid overly saturated or trendy colors
- Likely: Deep blues, soft golds, cream/ivory backgrounds

---

### 2. **TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM**
- **Headline font** - for slide titles (likely serif for Rumi's voice)
- **Body font** - for descriptive text (clean sans-serif for readability)
- **Quote/poetry font** - elegant serif for Rumi quotes
- **Data/numbers font** - clear, legible for charts and metrics
- **Hierarchy** - sizing scale (H1, H2, H3, body, caption)

**Considerations:**
- Needs to work for both spiritual content and business data
- Serif for Rumi's words (dignity, timelessness)
- Sans-serif for UI/business content (clarity, modernity)

---

### 3. **ICONS**

**Considerations:**

### 4. **ILLUSTRATIONS & IMAGERY**
- **Rumi illustration** - the existing portrait (hero asset for Cover & Closing)

---

### 6. **LAYOUT COMPONENTS**

- **Slide templates** - for different content types (text-heavy, visual-heavy, data)
- **Text blocks** - containers/frames for body copy
- **Callout boxes** - for key insights or quotes
- **Dividers/separators** - section breaks

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO MAINTAIN

### Visual Balance: Sanctuary + Credibility
- **Spiritual elements:** Soft gradients, contemplative imagery, elegant typography, generous white space
- **Business elements:** Clean data viz, professional layouts, clear hierarchy, confident messaging
- **Integration:** Neither dominates; spiritual beauty frames rigorous business case

### Hierarchy of Communication
- **Primary:** Big, bold headlines that tell the story at a glance
- **Secondary:** Supporting data and proof points
- **Tertiary:** Design details that create emotional resonance

### Contrast Strategy
- **Slide 2 (Problem):** Visual chaos of fragmented quotes → clean text block
- **Slide 4 (Solution):** Beautiful app mockups front and center
- **Slide 8-10:** Data-heavy slides → clean, professional charts
- **Slide 16:** Emotional, visual closing with Rumi's voice

### Tone Through Design
- Confident, not apologetic
- Deep, not shallow
- Invitational, not desperate
- Professional, not clinical
- Mystical, not New Age-y
